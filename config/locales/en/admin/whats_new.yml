        updates:
          - heading: New call for evidence content type
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: new
            date: 9 August 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              We have released a call for evidence content type in Whitehall. This is similar to consultations, but is now available in the new document menu. Outcomes are optional, but for details [read more in the GOV.UK guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/calls-for-evidence).
          - heading: New images
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: new
            date: 3 August 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              Images that have been added now display on the document summary page, before you publish. You can also go to the images edit screen from the document summary.
          - heading: New Markdown for attachments
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: improvement
            date: 1 August 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              We have updated the way you can add attachments. The attachment tab now includes the Markdown to add to your document and a ‘copy to clipboard’ button, similar to images. The Markdown you will use will now be based on the file name of the document, rather than `!@1` or `[InlineAttachment:1]`, although this will still work.
          - heading: Review dates and email reminders on all content types
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: new
            date: 18 July 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              When creating a document, there is a now a review dates section. You can find this under 'Schedule publication.'

              Setting a review date is optional, but it allows you, or your team, to receive an email reminder when content needs to be reviewed.

              You can also edit and manage a review date from the document summary screen.
          - heading: New page for uploading and managing images
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: change
            date: 11 May 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              There is now an images tab where you can upload and manage images for your document. This appears after you save a document.

              You can now upload images bigger than 960 pixels wide by 640 pixels high for edition or document pages and resize them with a new cropping tool.

              The image file name is now used as the Markdown to add the image to the body text.

            body_govspeak: |
              History and notes have been merged into a single history tab on the edition summary page. Internal notes will be shown alongside a document’s history.

              ‘Remarks’ or ‘editorial remarks’ are now known as ‘internal notes’.
