              As mentioned in the roadmap overview, we are working on the underlying technical design of Whitehall to make future development easier. As part of this work, we have made some changes to how news articles work in Whitehall.

              While the changes behind the scenes are a significant step forward, publishers should notice only a few small differences when creating and managing news articles:

               - The news article type is selected before drafting content.
               - The primary language is set in the Settings section of the document.
               - The lead image is selected using a dropdown.

              [See the basecamp post for details](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/buckets/15005645/messages/9271188619).

              
          - heading: Drag and drop (bulk) image uploads in Whitehall
            area: Managing images
            type: improvement
            date: 03 November 2025
            body_govspeak: |
               On the document Image tab you can now upload single or multiple files by either choosing them or dragging them to the page.
               
               Once the images are uploaded you will see them listed. You can then crop them (if needed), add the caption, copy the Markdown and select the Lead image as before.
               
               [See the basecamp post for details](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/buckets/15005645/messages/9231783110). 
               
               This should speed up the process of adding images to documents in Whitehall, especially when adding multiple images.
          - heading: Unpublishing reason shows on summary pages
            area: Managing documents and editions
            type: improvement
            date: 04 September 2025
            body_govspeak: |
               Previously, the reason for unpublishing was not made clear on the summary page of an edition. Now, if an edition has been unpublished, the reason for unpublishing will be shown in the status section on the summary page.

               Examples:

               - Unpublished (3 months ago) due to being published in error
               - Unpublished (5 months ago) due to being consolidated into another page
               
               This helps publishers and reviewers understand why an edition was unpublished.
          - heading: Consolidation of single and bulk attachments uploading 
            area: Adding attachments
            type: improvement
            date: 04 September 2025
            body_govspeak: |
               In a tweak to the user interface, the single and bulk upload options have been consolidated into one "Add attachment" component. This simplifies the process of adding attachments to a document.
          - heading: Bulk uploading attachments without .zip files
            area: Adding attachments
            type: improvement
            date: 25 July 2025
            body_govspeak: |
               Previously, publishers were required to put files in a .zip before bulk uploading. This is no longer the case. Publishers can upload (or drag and drop) files directly onto the page.
               
               [See the basecamp post for details](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/buckets/15005645/messages/8893161083).
          - heading: Whitehall search for "Only invalid editions"
            area: Searching for documents
            type: improvement
            date: 17 July 2025
            body_govspeak: |
               Searches can now show all of the editions that have issues that would need addressing if you were to try to publish a new edition of that document. This helps departments see where there are issues and take remedial action. 
               
               [See the basecamp post for details](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/buckets/15005645/messages/8869164879).
          - heading: Seeing validation issues on summary pages
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: improvement
            date: 17 July 2025
            body_govspeak: |
              We are now surfacing all validation issues in the sidebar of each edition on the summary page. This makes it clear at a glance what issue needs fixing (without having to try to publish or schedule the edition first).
              
              [See the basecamp post for details](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/buckets/15005645/messages/8869164879).
          - heading: Adding topic taxonomy tags to scheduled content
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: change
            date: 15 July 2025
            body_govspeak: |
              It is no longer possible to schedule content to be published without adding topic taxonomy tags. Publishers and reviewers will no longer be able to "Force schedule" content without adding a tag. 
              
              This helps ensure the email subscriptions and filtering through search work as expected.

              [See the basecamp post for details](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/buckets/15005645/messages/8872624190)
          - heading: Dangerous links removed from Whitehall content
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: security
            date: 08 April 2025
            body_govspeak: |
              A number of URLs on Whitehall pages were discovered to now go through to “inappropriate” content on third-party sites.

              Work was done to monitor this and automate the removal of the dangerous links. This may result in the force publishing of content. When this happens a message will show saying: “This edition has been superseded” and internal note saying “Dangerous links automatically removed” will be added.
          - heading: Removing unwanted assets
            area: Supporting and managing content
            type: maintenance
            date: January 2025
            body_govspeak: |
              Throughout 2024 we noticed an increasing number of support tickets alerting us to assets (mostly PDFs) that had remained live despite the publishers removing them in Whitehall. We investigated the issues and removed 146,000 superseded assets for the system. We also solved some of the underlying issues that had caused the problems to occur. 

              This reduced the number of support issues related to the issue from 3-5 per week to a handful per quarter.
