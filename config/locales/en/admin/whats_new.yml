          Whitehall Publisher will be moving from the current styling to use the styling and components of the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).
          This will make Whitehall Publisher more accessible, more user friendly and give you a consistent user experience throughout your publishing journey on GOV.UK.
