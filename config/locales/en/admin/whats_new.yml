      title: What’s new in Whitehall Publisher
      summary: |
        Summary of updates from the GOV.UK publishing team on Whitehall Publisher, the roadmap, and getting involved
      last_updated: Last updated 18 July 2025
      introduction:
        heading: Roadmap overview
        body_govspeak: |
          Now:

          - We continue to work on the support and feature request backlog. 
          - We are refactoring some of Whitehall's underlying technical design to make future development of content types easier.
          - We are exploring how Whitehall might support new layouts for some pages.

          Next:

          - We will revisit how "Visual editor" might improve content creation.
          - We will be considering options for improving how access and permissions work in Whitehall.

        updates:
          - heading: Whitehall search for "Only invalid editions"
            area: Searching for documents
            type: improvement
            date: 17 July 2025
            body_govspeak: |
               Searches can now show all of the editions that have issues that would need addressing if you were to try to publish a new edition of that document. This helps departments see where there are issues and take remedial action. 
               
               [See the basecamp post for details](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/buckets/15005645/messages/8869164879).
          - heading: Seeing validation issues on summary pages
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: improvement
            date: 17 July 2025
            body_govspeak: |
              We are now surfacing all validation issues in the sidebar of each edition on the summary page. This makes it clear at a glance what issue needs fixing (without having to try to publish or schedule the edition first).
              
              [See the basecamp post for details](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/buckets/15005645/messages/8869164879).
          - heading: Adding topic taxonomy tags to scheduled content
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: change
            date: 15 July 2025
            body_govspeak: |
              It is no longer possible to schedule content to be published without adding topic taxonomy tags. Publishers and reviewers will no longer be able to "Force schedule" content without adding a tag. 
              
              This helps ensure the email subscriptions and filtering through search work as expected.

          - heading: Dangerous links removed from Whitehall content
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: security
            date: 08 April 2025
            body_govspeak: |
              A number of URLs on Whitehall pages were discovered to now go through to “inappropriate” content on third-party sites.

              Work was done to monitor this and automate the removal of the dangerous links. This may result in the force publishing of content. When this happens a message will show saying: “This edition has been superseded” and internal note saying “Dangerous links automatically removed” will be added.
          - heading: Removing unwanted assets
            area: Supporting and managing content
            type: maintenance
            date: January 2025
            body_govspeak: |
              Throughout 2024 we noticed an increasing number of support tickets alerting us to assets (mostly PDFs) that had remained live despite the publishers removing them in Whitehall. We investigated the issues and removed 146,000 superseded assets for the system. We also solved some of the underlying issues that had caused the problems to occur. 

              This reduced the number of support issues related to the issue from 3-5 per week to a handful per quarter.
