          - heading: Specialist topic tags removed
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: change
            date: 29 February 2024
            body_govspeak: |
              All specialist topic pages have now been archived and we have removed the step to tag content to specialist topics. Find out more about [why we’ve retired specialist topic pages](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/buckets/15005645/messages/5444046751).
          - heading: Changes to adding lead images in Whitehall
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: improvement
            date: 7 November 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              We've made some changes to adding lead images in Whitehall:

              - for Case Studies you can use your organisations default news image or any uploaded image as your lead image
              - for News Articles you can choose any of the uploaded images as the lead image
          - heading: Unpublishing documents puts them into a new "Unpublished" state
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: change
            date: 19 October 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              The “Unpublish” document button no longer changes a published document back into a draft. Instead, the document is put into a new “Unpublished” state.

              This means that unpublished documents will no longer appear in your “My Draft Documents” area of the dashboard. You can also filter the documents list for unpublished documents.
          - heading: Pasting tables to markdown in the document body editor
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: new
            date: 29 September 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              There is now experimental support for pasting tables from other applications into the body editor and having them automatically translated to markdown. Note that this feature may not always behave as expected, especially in cases where the table cells contain multiples lines of content, and you should check the table is rendered correctly using the preview before publishing. Please let us know if you encounter cases where the generated markdown could be improved.

            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: new
            date: 8 September
            body_govspeak: |
              The "Save and continue" button no longer prompts users to update topic tags. Instead, it takes you directly to the document summary page. The save buttons have been updated to reflect this: "Save" saves your draft, and "Save and go to summary" goes to the document summary page.
          - heading: Preview on GOV.UK from the edit screen
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: new
            date: 25 August 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              Once your document is saved, you can now click a link to see a preview of what your content looks like on GOV.UK without having to visit the document summary screen.
          - heading: New call for evidence content type
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: new
            date: 9 August 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              We have released a call for evidence content type in Whitehall. This is similar to consultations, but is now available in the new document menu. Outcomes are optional, but for details [read more in the GOV.UK guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/calls-for-evidence).
          - heading: New images
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: new
            date: 3 August 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              Images that have been added now display on the document summary page, before you publish. You can also go to the images edit screen from the document summary.
          - heading: New Markdown for attachments
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: improvement
            date: 1 August 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              We have updated the way you can add attachments. The attachment tab now includes the Markdown to add to your document and a ‘copy to clipboard’ button, similar to images. The Markdown you will use will now be based on the file name of the document, rather than `!@1` or `[InlineAttachment:1]`, although this will still work.
          - heading: Review dates and email reminders on all content types
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: new
            date: 18 July 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              When creating a document, there is a now a review dates section. You can find this under 'Schedule publication.'

              Setting a review date is optional, but it allows you, or your team, to receive an email reminder when content needs to be reviewed.

              You can also edit and manage a review date from the document summary screen.
          - heading: New page for uploading and managing images
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: change
            date: 11 May 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              There is now an images tab where you can upload and manage images for your document. This appears after you save a document.

              You can now upload images bigger than 960 pixels wide by 640 pixels high for edition or document pages and resize them with a new cropping tool.

              The image file name is now used as the Markdown to add the image to the body text.
          - heading: Edit edition page moved to the Design System
            type: improvement
            date: 11 May 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              The edit edition page has moved to use the GOV.UK Design System. This includes translations.
          - heading: Document history and notes can now be filtered
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: change
            date: 13 February 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              Based on feedback from publishers, we’ve added a filter for history and internal notes on the edition summary page.
          - heading: Document history and notes have been merged
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: change
            date: 2 February 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              History and notes have been merged into a single history tab on the edition summary page. Internal notes will be shown alongside a document’s history.

              ‘Remarks’ or ‘editorial remarks’ are now known as ‘internal notes’.
          - heading: Edition summary page and worldwide tagging move to the Design System
            area: Creating and updating documents
            type: improvement
            date: 2 February 2023
            body_govspeak: |
              The edition summary page (where you can do things like previewing, history and notes, submitting for 2i or publishing) and worldwide tagging have moved to use the GOV.UK Design System.
