  # CSS Modules export mode
  # Controls how CSS Module class names are exported in JavaScript
  # Defaults to 'named' if not specified. Uncomment and change to 'default' for v8 behavior.

  #   - named (default): Use named exports with camelCase conversion (v9 default)
  #     Example: import { button } from './styles.module.css'
  #   - default: Use default export with both original and camelCase names (v8 behavior)
