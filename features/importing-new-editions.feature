Feature: Importing new editions
  We want to be able to import editions into our database which don't have all
  the data filled in. The idea is to enable editors to 'speed tag' them with
  all the associations they need, and send them directly to draft state.

  - Can specify the Organisation that is being imported on the import page
  - When importing:
    - The state of the new editions is set to imported
    - Depending on the main document type, the publication sub type and the speech type default to ImportedAwaitingType if the data field is unfilled
    - The organisation is defaulted to the selected organisation if not filled in. If filled in and valid, we use that organisation in preference. If the field is filled in and unrecognised then the import will fail. If the column is missing we default all rows to the selected organisation.
    - The speech "delivered by" field is left unfilled if not filled in
    - Unrecognised non-blank "tag" fields will cause an import failure
  - The following validation differences from draft editions apply to imported editions:
    - The publication sub type can be ImportedAwaitingType for publications
    - "Delivered by" is allowed to be blank for speeches
    - Speech type can be ImportedAwaitingType for speeches
  - The normal validation rules apply when converting this into draft - ImportedAwaitingType is not a valid type for non-imported editions
  - The "convert to draft" button will give a descriptive error if the above validation exceptions for imported editions haven't been corrected

  More detail on how we deal with individual fields:
