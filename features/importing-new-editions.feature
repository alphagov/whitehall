Feature: Importing new editions
  We want to be able to import editions into our database which don't have all the data filled in. The idea is to enable editors to 'speed tag' them with all the associations they need, and send them directly to draft state.

  - Can specify the Organisation that is being imported on the import page
  - When importing:
    - The state of the new editions is set to imported
    - Depending on the main document type, the publication sub type and the speech type default to ImportedAwaitingType if the data field is unfilled
    - The organisation is defaulted to the selected organisation if not filled in. If filled in and valid, we use that organisation in preference. If the field is filled in and unrecognised then the import will fail. If the column is missing we default all rows to the selected organisation.
    - The speech "delivered by" field is left unfilled if not filled in
    - Unrecognised non-blank "tag" fields will cause an import failure
  - The following validation differences from draft editions apply to imported editions:
    - The publication sub type can be ImportedAwaitingType for publications
    - "Delivered by" is allowed to be blank for speeches
    - Speech type can be ImportedAwaitingType for speeches
  - The normal validation rules apply when converting this into draft - ImportedAwaitingType is not a valid type for non-imported editions
  - The "convert to draft" button will give a descriptive error if the above validation exceptions for imported editions haven't been corrected

  Background:
    Given I am an importer

  Scenario: Importing publications with unrecognised types will be rejected
    When I import the following data as CSV as "Publication" for "Department for Transport":
      |old_url|title|summary|body|organisation|policy_1|publication_type|document_series|publication_date|order_url|price|isbn|urn|command_paper_number|ignore_1|attachment_1_url|attachment_1_title|country_1|
      |http://example.com/1|title|summary|body|weird organisation||weird type||14-Dec-2011||||||||||
    Then the import should fail with errors about organisation and sub type and no editions are created

  Scenario: Importing publication with organisation already set in the data
    Given the organisation "Foreign Commonwealth Office" exists
    When I import the following data as CSV as "Publication" for "Department for Transport":
      |old_url|title|summary|body|organisation|policy_1|publication_type|document_series|publication_date|order_url|price|isbn|urn|command_paper_number|ignore_1|attachment_1_url|attachment_1_title|country_1|
      |http://example.com/1|title|summary|body|foreign-commonwealth-office||||14-Dec-2011||||||||||
    Then the import succeeds, creating 1 imported publication for "Foreign Commonwealth Office" with "imported-awaiting-type" publication type

  Scenario: Importing publications sets imported state, ImportedAwaitingType type and default organisation, to be filled in later
    When I import the following data as CSV as "Publication" for "Department for Transport":
      |old_url|title|summary|body|organisation|policy_1|publication_type|document_series|publication_date|order_url|price|isbn|urn|command_paper_number|ignore_1|attachment_1_url|attachment_1_title|country_1|
      |http://example.com/1|title|summary|body|||||14-Dec-2011||||||||||
    Then the import succeeds, creating 1 imported publication for "Department for Transport" with "imported-awaiting-type" publication type
    And I can't make the imported publication into a draft edition yet
    When I set the imported publication's type to "Policy paper"
    Then I can make the imported publication into a draft edition

  Scenario: Importing speeches sets ImportedAwaitingType speech type and blank "delivered by", to be filled in later
    When I import the following data as CSV as "Speech" for "Department for Transport":
      |old_url|title|summary|body|organisation|policy_1|type|delivered_by|delivered_on|event_and_location|country_1|
      |http://example.com/1|title|summary|body|||||14-Dec-2011|location||
    Then the import succeeds, creating 1 imported speech with "imported-awaiting-type" speech type and with no deliverer set
    And the imported speech's organisation is set to "Department for Transport"
    Then I can't make the imported speech into a draft edition yet
    When I set the deliverer of the speech to "Joe Bloggs" from the "Foreign Commonwealth Office"
    And I can't make the imported speech into a draft edition yet
    When I set the imported speech's type to "Transcript"
    Then I can make the imported speech into a draft edition
    And the speech's organisation is set to "Foreign Commonwealth Office"

  Scenario: Importing edition and then deleting it
    When I import the following data as CSV as "Speech" for "Department for Transport":
      |old_url|title|summary|body|organisation|policy_1|type|delivered_by|delivered_on|event_and_location|country_1|
      |http://example.com/1|title|summary|body|||||14-Dec-2011|location||
    Then I can delete the imported edition if I choose to
