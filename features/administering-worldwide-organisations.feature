Feature: Administering worldwide organisation
  As a citizen interested in UK gov activity around the world, I want there to be profiles of the world organisation (eg embassies, DFID offices, UKTI branches) in each worldwide location, so I can see which organisation are active in each location and read more about them.

  Acceptance criteria:

  * Each world organisation has:
    * a unique name e.g. "British Embassy in Madrid" and a URL "/world/offices/british-embassy-in-madrid" which is generated from the name
    * a text short summary and markdown long description.
    * multiple social media links (like orgs)
    * multiple sets of office information (like orgs)
      * with the addition of a list of services (chosen from a set) that the office provides
    * a logo formatted name (always using the standard HMG crest for now)
  * Each world organisation can be associated with 1+ world locations, and shows on the world locations page to which they are associated (see mock up on the [ticket](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/41026113))
  * Each can have corporate information pages (like orgs)
