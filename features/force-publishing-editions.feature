  Scenario: Force-publishing a submitted edition
    Given I draft a new publication "Ban Beards"
    When I force publish the publication "Ban Beards"
    Then the publication "Ban Beards" should have a force publish reason

  Scenario: Retrospective second-pair of eyes
    Given I draft a new publication "Ban Beards"
    And I force publish the publication "Ban Beards"
    When another editor retrospectively approves the "Ban Beards" publication
    Then the "Ban Beards" publication should not be flagged as force-published any more
