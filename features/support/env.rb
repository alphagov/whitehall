# By default, any exception happening in your Rails application will bubble up
# to Cucumber so that your scenario will fail. This is a different from how
# your application behaves in the production environment, where an error page will
# be rendered instead.
#
# Sometimes we want to override this default behaviour and allow Rails to rescue
# exceptions and display an error page (just like when the app is running in production).
# Typical scenarios where you want to do this is when you test your error pages.
# There are two ways to allow Rails to rescue exceptions:
#
# 1) Tag your scenario (or feature) with @allow-rescue
#
# 2) Set the value below to true. Beware that doing this globally is not
# recommended as it will mask a lot of errors for you!
#
ActionController::Base.allow_rescue = false

# The transaction strategy is fine (and faster) for plain-old cucumber tests. It's only the javaascript
# tests where we spin up the app in a separate thread where we need to employ a truncation strategy
# See https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/blob/master/features/choose_javascript_database_strategy.feature
DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
Cucumber::Rails::Database.javascript_strategy = :truncation

# You may also want to configure DatabaseCleaner to use different strategies for certain features and scenarios.
# See the DatabaseCleaner documentation for details. Example:
#
#   Before('@no-txn,@selenium,@culerity,@celerity,@javascript') do
#     # { :except => [:widgets] } may not do what you expect here
#     # as Cucumber::Rails::Database.javascript_strategy overrides
#     # this setting.
#     DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
#   end
#
#   Before('~@no-txn', '~@selenium', '~@culerity', '~@celerity', '~@javascript') do
#     DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
#   end
#
