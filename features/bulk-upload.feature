Feature: Bulk uploading attachments to editions

  Background:
    Given I am a writer

    Scenario: Uploading mulitple attachments from a zip file
      Given a draft news article "Stubble to be Outlawed" exists
      When I upload a zip file containing several attachments and give them titles
      Then I should see that the news article has attachments

    Scenario: Replacing existing attachments with a zip file
      Given a draft publication "Results of beards survay" with attachment "greenpaper.pdf" exists
      When I upload a zip file that contains a file "greenpaper.pdf"
      Then the greenpaper.pdf attachment file should be replaced with the new file
      And any other files should be added as new attachments
