Feature: World location news for people local to countries
  As a citizen,
  I want news articles which are only relevant in a specific world location to be excluded from the main list of announcements on inside government unless I choose to see them,
  So that I can ignore this niche interest content unless I want it

  ---

  A way of creating a 'world location specific' news article

  Include these on the location page's list of recent announcements,
  latest feed etc, and allow them to be featured on a world location
  page

  Omit these from the /announcements list unless a frontend user
  selects to reveal them (needs UX input, but something like a
  checkbox below the worldwide filter: 'Include location-specific
  news' defaulting to unchecked).

  Users can still see any standard news articles that are tagged to
  countries (eg FCO news about Syria) - only the location-specific
  stuff should be filtered out

  'See all our announcements' link from the location goes to filtered
  announcements list including the location specific stuff

  World location-specific news articles should be associated to
  Worldwide organisations, as well as to locations, so the world
  organisation logos are shown as the producing orgs

  Background:
    Given I am an GDS editor

  Scenario: Create a world location news article
    When I draft a valid world location news article "Beirut News"
    Then the world location news article "Beirut News" should have been created

  Scenario: Associate a world location news article with a worldwide organisation
    Given the worldwide organisation "Spanish Department" exists
    When I draft a valid world location news article "Spanish News"
    Then I should be able to associate "Spanish News" with the worldwide organisation "Spanish Department"
    When I force publish the world location news article "Spanish News"
    Then the worldwide organisation "Spanish Department" is listed as a producing org on the world location news article "Spanish News"

  Scenario: Associate a world location news article with a topical event
    Given the topical event "French Topical Event" exists
    When I draft a valid world location news article "French News"
    Then I should be able to associate "French News" with the topical event "French Topical Event"
    When I force publish the world location news article "French News"
    Then the topical event "French Topical Event" is listed as a topical event on the world location news article "French News"

  Scenario: Associate a world location news article with a world location
    Given a world location "Indonesia" exists
    When I draft a valid world location news article "Indonesian Beer"
    Then I should be able to associate "Indonesian Beer" with the world location "Indonesia"
    When I force publish the world location news article "Indonesian Beer"
    Then the world location news article "Indonesian Beer" appears on the world location "Indonesia"
    When I click through to see all the announcements for world location "Indonesia"
    Then I should see the world location news article "Indonesian Beer"

  @not-quite-as-fake-search
  Scenario: World location news on the announcements index
    Given there is a world location news article
    When I browse to the announcements index
    Then I should not be able to see the world location news article
    When I explicitly ask for world location news to be included
    Then I should be able to see the world location news article

  Scenario: View news articles relating to an world location
    Given a world location "British Antarctic Territory" exists
    And a published news article "Larsen ice sheet disintegrates" exists relating to the world location "British Antarctic Territory"
    When I view the world location "British Antarctic Territory"
    Then I should see the news article "Larsen ice sheet disintegrates"

  Scenario: Inactive world locations are listed but not linked
    Given the world location "Democratic People's Republic of South London" is inactive
    When I visit the world locations page
    Then I should see a world location called "Democratic People's Republic of South London"
    But I should not see a link to the world location called "Democratic People's Republic of South London"

  Scenario: World locations tell me what type they are
    Given a world location "Spain" exists
    And an international delegation "United Nations" exists

    When I view the world location "Spain"
    Then I should see that it is a world location

    When I view the world location "United Nations"
    Then I should see that it is an international delegation
