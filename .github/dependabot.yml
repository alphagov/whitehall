  # Ruby needs to be upgraded manually in multiple places, so cannot
  # be upgraded by Dependabot. That effectively makes the below
  # config redundant, as ruby is the only updatable thing in the
  # Dockerfile, although this may change in the future. We hope this
  # config will save a dev from trying to upgrade ruby via Dependabot.
