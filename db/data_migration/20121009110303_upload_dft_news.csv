http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120709a,Blue Badge consultation opens,The Department for Transport is consulting on proposed changes for assessing eligibility for blue disabled parking badges.,"The Department for Transport is [consulting on how to bring the process for assessing eligibility for blue disabled parking badges](/consultations/dft-2012-30/) in to line with the wider reform of disability benefits announced by the Department for Work and Pensions.

The Department's preferred option for bringing the process in line with new legislation is not expected to significantly affect the overall numbers of people entitled to blue badges.

Currently, people are [entitled to a blue badge](/topics/access/blue-badge) if they receive a certain component of the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) that relates to mobility.

The DLA is being replaced by the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and so the Department needs to look at the way the Blue Badge system is administered to ensure a smooth transition when the new benefits structure is introduced.

The consultation published today outlines the options under consideration. The Department's preferred option is to ensure decisions are consistent, using the criteria in the new PIP system that most closely correspond to those currently used by local authorities to carry out their own assessments.

The Government's review of Non-Departmental Public Bodies in 2010, recommended that the Disabled Persons' Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) be abolished as part of wider goals to increase accountability, reduce duplication of activity and improve transparency.

However, the Department needs to ensure continued access to high quality, balanced advice on the particular issues faced by people with disabilities when travelling. Today's consultation outlines a number of options for securing future advice should the decision be taken to abolish DPTAC.

Any cyclist, from enthusiasts planning a fun and healthy countryside ride over the long weekend to families looking for a safe, pretty route linking city parks can benefit from the Department for Transport's online cycling journey planner.

Part of the Transport Direct Portal, the planner now covers every road in England. Cyclists tap in their planned start and end points and the tool calculates a route that suits.

Users can easily tweak the settings to meet their needs, filtering journeys to select the quickest, quietest or most recreational routes - those which take them through parks and green spaces. The planner can even plot routes avoiding steep hills.

Norman Baker said:

>Cycling is a fantastic leisure activity that's becoming increasingly popular, and rightly so.

>It's good fun, it's good for the environment and it's good for your health. Indeed, the Chief Medical Officer has suggested that if cycling were discovered today it would be hailed as a miracle cure.

>Our route planner helps people wanting to get out and about and enjoy cycling, as well as those who want to map the best bike route to work.

As well as being great for those cycling for leisure, the planner is also designed to be used by those commuting by bike, who can use the online tool to find a well-lit, direct route to and from work.

The Transport Direct Portal receives more than 2 million visits a month and increasing numbers of people are using the website to plan their journeys by bike.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110530,Supermarkets support government crack down on blue badge abuse,Support from major supermarket chains for government's drive to eradicate blue badge abuse.,"Following major reforms to the Blue Badge scheme announced earlier this year, seven major supermarket chains have now given their support for the Government's drive to eradicate Blue Badge abuse.

Responding to the concerns of disability groups, Local Transport Minister Norman Baker wrote to all major supermarkets urging them to do what they could to enforce the scheme on their premises. So far Aldi, Marks and Spencer, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Waitrose and Lidl have all responded positively in support of the Government's drive to ensure strict enforcement of the parking bays in their car parks which are privately owned. 

Norman Baker said:

>Many disabled people and disability groups have told me about the problems they have in finding a disabled bay at supermarkets because of their abuse by people who have no justification for parking in reserved spaces. 

>I am delighted to have secured the support of the major supermarket groups and to know that they share my view that abuse of Blue Badge parking bays needs to be tackled, protecting customers who rely on such spaces. I hope other large retailers will now follow suit and consider what action they can take to help their Blue Badge customers.

The badges provide a vital lifeline to over 2.5 million disabled people every year by prioritising key parking spaces close to important services. However, rising levels of badge fraud have prevented those who genuinely need to use the parking spaces from doing so.

The seven supermarkets have said that drivers found abusing designated disabled bays will be issued with parking charge notices in some circumstances, alongside other measures including car park patrols, leafleting of vehicles and requests over in-store tannoys. 

The major reforms to the Blue Badge scheme announced by Norman Baker earlier this year include a new badge design that is harder to forge, as well as improved enforcement powers for local authorities. However, the scheme does not cover privately owned car parks. The support of supermarkets is therefore an important step in ensuring wider enforcement of the scheme. 

Following a competitive procurement exercise, Northgate Public Services and Payne Security have been awarded a contract to help make improvements to the Blue Badge scheme, which will include:

* Shared administration between authorities including an online eligibility checker and an online application form available via Directgov, resulting in faster renewals, reduced abuse and operational savings; 

* a secure central database of all Blue Badges on issue and key information on badge holders that will enable fraud prevention and better enforcement;

* secure printing, personalisation and distribution of the new Blue Badge design provided by Northgate's partner, Payne Security.

A Lidl spokesperson said:

>At Lidl, we are fully committed to assisting the Department for Transport's successful implementation and modernisation of the Blue Badge scheme. We will continue our ongoing, effective monitoring of our car parks and enforcement methods to prevent abuse of the disabled parking bays at our stores.

Gwyn Burr, Sainsbury's Customer Service and Colleague Director, said: 

>We know the Blue Badge scheme is an issue close to our customers' hearts. In 2009 we became the first supermarket to actively manage all of the disabled bays within our car parks and this led to a reduction in the misuse of these spaces, a fact recognised by the Baywatch survey last year. We are very pleased to support this campaign.

Mark Gunter, Group Retail Director of Morrison's, said: 

>We have always been concerned about the abuse of disabled parking spaces and we will penalise those able-bodied drivers that incorrectly park in spaces allocated for blue-badge drivers. However, we also depend on the public to help us ensure that these parking bays remain available for disabled drivers.

The new service delivery improvements to the Blue Badge scheme will be operational from 1st January 2012.

The capital costs involved in the development of the system will be funded by Northgate and Payne Security, who will re-coup their investment over the lifetime of the five-year contract via a charge to local authorities per badge issued.

Dave Meaden, Chief Executive of Northgate Public Services said:

>The Blue Badge scheme is an essential service for disabled people. We are committed to making it more effective for the millions who rely on it. This innovative programme is focused on enhancing vital local services through preventing abuse, improving delivery and planning for increased demand in the future. In difficult times, it shows that improvements for people really can be achieved through new ways of working and using resources.

**Notes to Editors**

  * There are 2.55 million badge holders in England and demand is rising significantly in line with the average age of the population. Current levels of abuse are high as the financial benefits of having a badge are significant. Consultations with disabled people, local authorities and other stakeholders have demonstrated a large amount of support for changes to be made to ensure the long term sustainability of the scheme for those who rely on it the most. This includes reforms that will help to ensure a fair allocation of badges, deliver efficiency savings and improve customer services and to tackle and reduce current levels of abuse.
  * The Blue Badge scheme only applies to on-street parking. Private off-street car parks, such as those at supermarkets, are on private land and the charges and conditions of use are essentially a contractual matter between the owner and the motorist. However, the Equality Act 2010 requires providers of services, including car park operators, to take reasonable steps to ensure disabled people are not substantially disadvantaged compared to non-disabled people, when accessing their services. This has implications for car park operators who may have to demonstrate that, as well as marking out disabled person's parking spaces, they have taken reasonable steps to ensure that they are available to disabled people.
  * Amongst the services available from the Blue Badge Improvement Service will be an on-line eligibility checker and an application form. This will enable people to quickly discover whether or not they may be eligible for a Blue Badge and, if they are, to then complete an on-line application form that will be sent through the system to the relevant issuing local authority. The local authority will make, as now, the decision on whether or not the individual should receive a badge.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110214,Government crackdown on Blue Badge abuse ,The Government is implementing major reforms to crack down on drivers who abuse the disabled parking system.,"The Government is implementing major reforms to crack down on drivers who abuse the disabled parking system as part of the most comprehensive changes to the Blue Badge scheme for 40 years, Transport Minister, Norman Baker, announced today.

Blue Badges provide a vital lifeline to over 2.5 million disabled people every year by prioritising key parking spaces close to important services. However increasing levels of badge fraud mean those who genuinely need to use these parking spaces often find themselves displaced by people who do not. In addition, the Government estimates that badge fraud is now costing the UK an estimated £46m a year, and is giving Councils tough new powers to tackle this growing issue. 

There have been very few changes to the Blue Badge scheme since it was introduced in the 1970s and the Government believes that it is in need of modernisation. 

The measures, which will start to come into force from April this year, include:

  * Providing local authorities with an on-the-spot power to recover badges that have been cancelled and misused; 
  * Shared administration between authorities - including an online application facility - resulting in faster renewals, reduced abuse and operational efficiency savings of up to £20 million a year;
  * Wider use of independent mobility assessments to determine eligibility, including where previously that assessment was carried out by a GP; and support for this by giving local authorities control of National Health Service spend on Blue Badge assessments;
  * The replacement of handwritten badges with standard electronic ones which are harder to alter and forge;
  * Extending the scheme to more disabled children under three years of age and severely disabled Armed Forces personnel and veterans; and removing residency requirements for disabled service personnel and their families who are posted overseas on UK bases

In order to finance the improvements, the maximum fee for a badge that local authorities can charge will rise from £2 to £10. This is the first increase in cost for 30 years and the Government believes that, in return, badge holders will benefit from less abuse, improved accessibility and better customer services.

Transport Minister, Norman Baker, said:

>The Blue Badge Scheme makes a real difference to millions of disabled people every day. However, it is clear that it is in real need of modernisation after forty years without major reform.

>Such are the high levels of fraud in the current system that 50% of Blue Badge holders now find it difficult to get a parking space and Blue Badge fraud is estimated to cost £46m a year.

>The changes I am announcing today will crack down on Blue Badge misuse, modernise the system and extend eligibility to other groups such as more disabled children under three and severely disabled war veterans and service personnel. These improvements will mean that Blue Badge holders get a much better service for less than 1p per day.

Dai Powell OBE, Chair of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) said:

>These proposals can bring us one step nearer to a fairer and more consistently applied scheme. DPTAC hope to continue working closely with the Department as it implements these measures to ensure they lead to better outcomes for disabled people.

Helen Dolphin, DPTAC Member and Director of Policy and Campaigns at Mobilise said:

>We are pleased DfT have addressed some of the anomalies providing greater clarity to those who administer the scheme. One of the major criticisms has been the extent of regional variation in the administration. We hope local authorities will recognise the benefits these measures will offer in support of a consistent and uniform approach.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-2010-1014,DfT announces reform of public bodies ,"Department for Transport public bodies to be abolished, reformed or brought inhouse.","The Department for Transport today announced significant reforms to a number of its public bodies following a cross-Government review.

The organisations to be abolished as public bodies are:

  * Cycling England
  * Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC);
  * Renewable Fuels Agency (RFA);
  * The Railway Heritage Committee;
  * The Commission for Integrated Transport; and
  * BRB (Residuary) Ltd.

Key functions of Cycling England and RFA will be brought in-house and successor arrangements for DPTAC will be consulted on.

One further body - Passenger Focus - will be retained, but substantially reformed to focus on the core role of protecting passengers while reducing costs to taxpayers.

Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, said: 

>Reducing the number of quangos on our books is vital to delivering transparent and accountable public services and will make an important contribution towards reducing the deficit.

>We are ensuring that only those bodies that absolutely need to continue as independent bodies are retained either in their current form or significantly slimmed down. The remainder we will either scrap, reform, or arrange for their functions to be delivered in-house without the need for separate arms-length bodies.

>I am confident that these reforms will significantly increase accountability, enhance public confidence in Government and make important savings, whilst continuing to meet our responsibilities to the travelling public.

The move is part of the Government-wide reform to increase accountability, deliver smaller government and improve efficiency, across Whitehall. 

Cycling England was set up as the independent expert body to advise on the promotion of cycling. The Government believes that this work can now be better delivered within the Department through the newly announced Local Sustainable Transport Fund. Bikeability - cycle proficiency for the 21st Century - will be supported for the remainder of this Parliament. DfT is also considering establishing an expert panel on wider sustainable travel which would promote cycling as part of the wider green agenda.

The Department will continue to ensure transport policies promote equality. However the legislation governing the **Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC)** is now 25 years old, and there is scope to reform the way disability advice is delivered to increase flexibility and accountability to the taxpayer. The Department will therefore consult on successor arrangements.

The Renewable Fuels Agency (RFA) administers the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation and provides a source of expert advice on biofuel sustainability but there is now scope to transfer its functions to the Department for Transport. The Department will work with the RFA to consider how best to achieve this transition and to ensure that potential savings are realised.

The Railway Heritage Committee (RHC) is responsible for designating railway artefacts and records of historical importance. The Government believes that the RHC can not be justified as no equivalent protection applies to the heritage of any other transport sector. The RHC will therefore be abolished. 

The Commission for Integrated Transport (CfIT) was established in 1999 to provide independent advice to Government on integrated transport policy in England via evidence-based research. However the department has concluded that the emphasis should now be on high-level strategic advice rather than detailed research. This can be achieved more cost effectively by the Department for Transport engaging directly with experts through a new informal strategic transport advisory group, rather than an arms length body.

BRB (Residuary) Ltd is responsible for discharging the residual functions of the British Railways Board following the divestment of British Rail's operating railway functions in 1997. BRBR will be wound up in due course once its programme of asset disposals is complete and its remaining statutory functions will transfer to the direct control of the Department for Transport.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120712b,Foundations laid for future growth of aviation as government unveils long-term strategy,Transport Secretary Justine Greening has published the draft aviation policy framework.,"More frequent flights to emerging markets, improved access to airports - including £500m towards a new rail link to Heathrow - and a reduction in the impact of airports on local communities is to be put at the heart of UK aviation strategy Transport Secretary Justine Greening has said, as she published the Government's long-term vision for the sector today.

The [draft policy framework](/consultations/dft-2012-35), which will form the basis of future sustainable aviation growth in the UK, has been developed following discussions with the industry. The framework also includes a package of measures which will quickly deliver operational improvements and boost economic growth within existing airport capacity constraints.

The measures include:

  * Further liberalisation of the UK aviation market to encourage foreign airlines to develop routes from airports other than Heathrow;
  * Improving reliability and reducing delays at Heathrow. If operational freedoms show clear benefits in terms of resilience, reducing delays and allowing planes to land more effectively, thereby reducing the impact of noise for residents under the flight path, then the Government will consult on making these benefits permanent;
  * Addressing the environmental and local impacts of aviation through: 
    * pushing for international action on aviation emissions while continuing to support EU Emissions Trading Scheme;
    * incentivising noise reduction though higher landing fees for noisier aircraft at unsociable hours and higher penalties for breaching noise limits at any time;
  * £500m towards a western rail link to Heathrow, which is in addition to £1.4bn already being invested to improve surface access to airports, including £44m towards upgrading Gatwick Airport station and a new fleet of thirty electric trains already improving services on the Stansted Express. In addition the Government is pressing ahead with HS2 which will significantly improve access to airports such as Birmingham and Manchester;
  * Improving efficiency at the border, including a review of the UK's visa regime, bringing forward the recruitment of 70 additional border staff at Heathrow and working with the US authorities to look at the options for speeding up entry into the US.
  * Supporting the introduction of new rules by airport operators to maximise their existing capacity, for example through limiting access to smaller aircraft;
  * Introducing airport performance charters which will set out the level of service that airlines and their passengers should expect from airport operators;
  * Improving the overall passenger experience through the Civil Aviation Bill which is expected to gain Royal Assent in 2013.

A separate call for evidence on how to maintain the UK's international connectivity and hub status will follow later in the year once the industry has had time to consider the measures put forward for consultation today.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>This framework aims to strike a balance between allowing the aviation industry to make the most of our current capacity, while also recognising the need for a tough regime to tackle levels of noise experienced by residents on the ground.

>London is already one of the best connected cities in the world, but there is still an important but challenging debate to be had on how we accommodate the long-term growth of aviation. This framework provides the building blocks for this debate and I look forward to working with the industry, residents and other interested parties on this once they have had the chance to consider these measures.

Today's draft Aviation Policy Framework document has been published on the Department for Transport's website and is subject to full public consultation, lasting until 31st October.

  2. Today's publication follows an exercise last year to seek industry and other stakeholder views on the future shape of aviation policy through the [scoping document: Developing a Sustainable Framework for Aviation](/consultations/dft-2011-09).

Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers is putting the spotlight on around 90 aviation regulations that have been placed on the Red Tape Challenge website today. The exercise gives people the opportunity to say whether they think that a regulation is well designed and provides vital protection or is badly designed, badly implemented or simply a bad idea.

Regulations under the spotlight include instances where UK rules go beyond the minimum required by EU or international legislation. The exercise also offers an opportunity to see if some of the UK's more historic aviation legislation is still fit for purpose and suited to today's aviation needs.

Areas for deregulatory consideration include:

  * Getting rid of all non-essential regulatory burdens on the aviation sector in order to unlock private sector-led economic growth;
  * Replacing obsolete legislation and delivering a new system of regulation, more focused than the current regime (work on this is already underway through the Civil Aviation Bill); and
  * Removing redundant regulation.

Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>This is a chance for everyone to have their say, whether they are a passenger, the owner of an airline or a light aircraft or are just an aviation enthusiast. We are determined to scrap any regulations which are disproportionate or obsolete, getting rid of non-essential regulatory burdens on the aviation sector.

>There's no doubt that good quality regulation can add real value to the competitiveness of the aviation industry while balancing genuine environmental, safety and security concerns. But reducing red tape by getting rid of regulations which are unnecessary means we can help UK businesses become more competitive and create more jobs.

The Government has recruited experienced 'sector champions' who will be providing expert knowledge during the Red Tape Challenge based on the issues they face in their fields. The sector champions for aviation are:

  * Simon Buck, Chief Executive, British Air Transport Association
  * Tim Johnson, Director, Aviation Environment Federation
  * Rob Siddall, Policy Director, Airport Operators Association
  * Mark Tanzer, Chief Executive, ABTA
  * Paul Bishop, Managing Director, DHL Air UK
  * James Tannock, Chief Executive, Light Aircraft Association
  * Marc Bailey, Chief Executive, British Business and General Aviation Association

Simon Buck, Chief Executive at British Air Transport Association, said:

>The airline industry faces regulation not just from UK authorities but also from European and global regulators. This why we welcome the Red Tape Challenge as a way of identifying and reducing national regulation that may have become unnecessary, burdensome or simply obsolete having been overlaid by international requirements and I am pleased to be involved with this initiative.

Tim Johnson, Director at Aviation Environment Federation, said:

>Regulation can both promote and impede effective environmental protection. Pausing to examine how legislation is working in practice is a valuable opportunity for us to identify if it is still relevant in terms of being practical to implement or promoting environmentally-beneficial outcomes.

Rob Siddall, Policy Director at Airport Operators Association, said:

>Helping ensure that the UK's airports operate in the right business climate to flourish is a core activity for The Airport Operators Association. The Red Tape Challenge operates right on that territory, by looking for regulation that's no longer needed or can be done differently. We're looking forward to playing our part in it.

Mark Tanzer, Chief Executive at the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), said:

>Aviation is the lifeblood connecting the UK to the world. Good aviation regulation is essential to a successful and thriving sector that could help to facilitate the growth desperately needed in the UK. Businesses within the aviation sector, and the many businesses dependent upon it, have a unique opportunity to identify to Government those pieces of regulation which are holding back growth.

The overall aim of the Red Tape Challenge, a Government-wide initiative to reduce bureaucracy, is to remove barriers to economic growth and increase individual freedoms. The presumption is that regulations will go, unless their retention can be justified.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The Red Tape Challenge was launched by the Prime Minister on 7 April 2011, giving the public a chance to have their say on the more than 10,000 regulations that affect their everyday lives.
  2. The Aviation Theme will go live on the Red Tape Challenge website on Thursday 28th June and can be found at: [http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/)
  3. 20 themes, totalling over 3700 regulations have been launched on the Red Tape Challenge website so far.
  4. Overall, of the 1500 regulations (across 8 themes) where Ministers have already made decisions, the Government has committed to scrap or improve well over 50% - decisions that will bring real benefits to business, civil society organisations and individuals.
  5. The Red Tape Challenge process does not include legislation falling within the responsibilities of the devolved administrations.
  6. For each sector theme, experienced 'Sector Champions' are appointed who will provide expert knowledge in their specialist field. The champion acts as an intermediary between the sector and Government, including helping to direct the web-based debates and discussions.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120209a,Millions of extra holidays protected as Government updates ATOL scheme,New measures to strengthen and modernise the ATOL holiday protection scheme.,"Up to six million extra holidays each year will be fully protected against the failure of a travel company after Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers confirmed measures to strengthen and modernise the ATOL holiday protection scheme today.

Running since the 1970s, the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing scheme offers customers whose holiday company becomes insolvent a full refund or repatriation at the end of their trip if they are already abroad.

Following a consultation last year, the changes confirmed today will come into effect on 30th April and will mean:

  * ""Flight-Plus"" holidays sold by tour operators and travel agents are included in the ATOL scheme. These are holidays that look like package holidays but are sold in a way which currently falls outside the scheme
  * passengers are given a standard, recognised certificate at the point of purchase, so they know whether their trip is protected by the ATOL scheme or not

Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>The ATOL scheme has been providing peace of mind for holidaymakers for decades, but the way we book holidays has changed and the scheme needs to move with the times. All too often customers are unsure as to whether they are protected or not.
 
>The changes I am making today will provide much needed clarity and reassurance for millions of people booking their holidays. These reforms will equip ATOL to deal with the realities of the modern holiday market, enabling the scheme to protect holiday makers for many more years to come. This is an important step forward for consumer protection.

The changes confirmed today will also help return the scheme to a more secure financial footing. Following a series of high-profile insolvencies in recent years, the fund which covers the costs of repatriation or refunds is currently running at a deficit, supported by a Government-backed guarantee. It is hoped the new rules will eliminate this within three years, reducing the risk to the taxpayer.

Last month the Government also introduced the Civil Aviation Bill into Parliament, including a clause which could enable the Secretary of State to make further changes to the ATOL scheme in future. These include the option to include holidays sold by airlines, which are currently exempt from the scheme, as well as the power to bring holidays arranged on an 'agent for the consumer' basis to be brought into the scheme. Subject to Parliamentary process, the Government would carry out a full consultation and impact assessment on any regulations that would give effect to these powers.

## Notes to editors

  * The ATOL scheme is administered by the Civil Aviation Authority and ensures passengers who have not already travelled receive a full refund, or are brought home free of charge if abroad at the time of insolvency.
  * An estimated 37.2 million people fly abroad on leisure trips each year. In the year to 31 March 2011 there were 18.5m ATOL protected holidays and flights, and over 190,000 holidaymakers were repatriated or received full refunds when their ATOL tour operator went bust.
  * Most businesses selling package holidays including a flight have to have an ATOL issued by the CAA. Businesses pay £2.50 for each booking into a Fund that meets the costs of refunds and repatriations.
  * The ATOL scheme was first put in place on a statutory basis in the early 1970s. It was last substantially overhauled in 1995.
  * A summary of consultation responses and further details on the new regulations are available on the Department for Transport website: [ATOL reform consultation](/consultations/dft-2011-17/)
  * Airlines are legally exempt from the requirement to hold an ATOL, however any package holidays they sell must still be financially protected, under the Package Travel Regulations. A number of UK airlines have subsequently set up subsidiary companies to sell package holidays that do have an ATOL.
  * Further details on the Civil Aviation Bill which is currently proceeding through Parliament are available on the Department for Transport website: [Civil Aviation Bill](/topics/legislation/civil-aviation-bill/)

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120119,New powers will put passengers first,Release about how new powers which will put passengers at the heart of how the UK's major airports are run have begun their passage through Parliament.,"New powers which will put passengers at the heart of how the UK's major airports are run have begun their passage through Parliament.

The [Civil Aviation Bill - which had its first reading in Parliament today](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/civilaviation.html) - will replace the current economic regulation duties of the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), with a single primary duty to promote the interests of passengers.

The Bill will also give the CAA more flexibility to set performance measures at major airports, encourage investment in improvements and provide passengers and other airport users - such as those sending cargo by air - with more information about airline and airport performance.

Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>The powers in this Bill will put the needs of passengers clearly and unambiguously at the heart of how our major airports are run. They will help promote better public information about airline and airport performance and give the CAA more power to tackle the issues which matter to passengers. Under the new rules, the CAA will be able to intervene much more quickly when an airport is failing passengers, for example on winter preparedness.

>The end result of these reforms will be a modern regulatory regime for our airports which is flexible, proportionate, targeted and effective, while unnecessary regulation and unnecessary intervention by central Government will be removed.

Much of the legislation surrounding aviation dates back to the 1980s; airlines and airports have welcomed the Government's intent to update it. The Bill is designed to modernise the key elements of how the industry is regulated and contribute to economic growth.

The Bill also proposes that the costs of regulating aviation security should be covered by the aviation industry as happens with safety regulation. This will involve conferring certain aviation security functions, such as monitoring and enforcement, on the CAA which charges the industry for its activities. However, the responsibility for setting aviation security policy and making aviation security directions to the industry will remain with the Secretary of State for Transport. It is estimated that this move could save UK taxpayers over £4m a year.

The Civil Aviation Bill also contains a clause which could enable the Secretary of State to make long-term changes to the ATOL holiday protection scheme. The clause provides the option to include holidays sold by airlines, which are currently exempt from the scheme, in the ATOL scheme. It also provides the power to bring holidays arranged on an 'agent for the consumer' basis into ATOL protection. Subject to Parliamentary process, the Government would carry out a full consultation including an impact assessment on any regulations that could give effect to these powers. The Government will shortly make a full announcement on ATOL reform, which will set out its decisions on the options for near-term reform as consulted on in summer 2011.

### Notes to editors

  1. The CAA currently has four duties for the purposes of economic regulation, they are: 
    * to further the reasonable interests of users of airports within the UK, users being defined (in section 82 of the Airports Act) as airlines, passengers and other user of air transport services at the airport;
    * to promote the efficient, economic and profitable operation of such airports ;
    * to encourage investment in new facilities at airports in time to satisfy anticipated demands by the users of such airports; and
    * to impose the minimum restrictions that are consistent with the performance by the CAA of its functions under those sections.
  2. In addition, the CAA is also required to take account of international obligations.
  3. The proposals set out today will replace these with a single primary duty and a limited number of further duties. These are: 

**Primary duty**

    * to further the interest of consumers (that is passengers and owners of cargo both present and future), wherever appropriate by promoting competition

**Further duties**

    * to ensure that licence holders are able to finance the activities which are subject to the relevant licence obligations;
    * to secure that all reasonable demands for airport services are met;
    * to promote economy and efficiency on the part of licence holders in its provisions of airport services at regulated airports;
    * to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State;
    * to have regard to any international obligation of the UK;
    * to have regard to principles of better regulation
  4. The Transport Select Committee has today published its report on the draft Civil Aviation Bill which was published in November 2011. The Committee's recommendations will be taken into consideration as the Bill proceeds through Parliament. The Department welcomes the TSC's finding that they have found ""general support from the aviation industry and the regulator for the measures proposed in the draft Bill."" The Committee has arranged to hear evidence on ATOL on 31 January and intends to report on this issue in due course.

Justine Greening said:

>Our airports will play a key part in the success of London 2012, providing for many the first impression of the country.

>I welcome Gatwick's commitment to invest £1 billion on improving facilities which will benefit visitors to the Games, but will also be something that passengers and travellers to the UK can benefit from for many years to come.

>The Olympics can be a real boost to jobs, businesses and tourism and I am determined that transport will play a full part.

This morning, Justine Greening attended a Cabinet meeting on the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, chaired by the Prime Minister David Cameron. The meeting focused on how every part of the UK can take full advantage of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the unique chance that the country has to sell itself to a massive international audience.

This afternoon, Cabinet Ministers are visiting towns and cities across the UK to see for themselves how businesses, sports facilities, schools and organisations are benefiting from the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

With little over seven months before the opening ceremony, the construction phase is 95% complete and the project continues to be on time and on budget. Since work began on the East London site in 2008, £6.39billion worth of contracts have been awarded to over 1500 business in the UK.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

>As we kick off 2012, the year of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Diamond Jubilee, this is the perfect time for the Cabinet to come together and ensure we are doing absolutely everything we can to make the most of this unique opportunity to showcase all the great things the UK has to offer to the rest of the world.

>As Ministers visit Olympic venues, businesses, schools and organisations associated with 2012 right across the UK, I want the message to go out loud and clear, from tourism to business, sport to investment, we are determined to maximise the benefits of 2012 for the whole country.

>Today, as we mark 200 days to go, and 6 out of the 8 Olympic venues having already secured their future, we are well on track to delivering a lasting legacy for the whole of Britain.

## Boosting tourism numbers

Hosting the Games this summer will put the United Kingdom in the international spotlight and the Government is committed to ensuring that the tourism sector maximises the benefits, boosting investment, jobs and growth. Domestic tourism will benefit from a 20.12 per cent discount initiative recently announced by Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt and during a trip to New York last September the Prime Minister launched the GREAT campaign which will focus on promoting globally everything the UK has to offer. The campaign will showcase the opportunities to invest in the UK and help to attract millions of extra visitors.

Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt said;

>London 2012 gives us an opportunity to showcase the best of Britain to the world and what this country has to offer. From our beautiful countryside to historic sites, sporting venues to our amazing cultural offer Britain really does have something for everyone.

>I am confident that we will put on a sporting spectacular this summer with some magical, medal moments that we will never forget and that will inspire many young people to get involved in sport.

Sports in the UK will also receive a boost as part of the Olympic legacy with many of the world-class venues being opened up to local communities and initiatives to support sport in schools, communities and elite athletes continuing after the Games.

Andrew Haines joined the CAA in August 2009 for an initial three-year term following a successful career in the rail industry. His appointment followed an open competition held in accordance with the Code of Practice published by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. He is the CAA's first Chief Executive. The position was created in response to Sir Joseph Pilling's 2008 strategic review of the Authority.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>Since his appointment in 2009, Andrew has helped bring fresh thinking to the CAA while maintaining the UK's excellent record in aviation safety. This vision and drive will be crucial in implementing the passenger-focused reforms to the Authority's functions and framework that the Government will introduce in the Civil Aviation Bill in 2012.

The Chair of the CAA, Dame Deirdre Hutton, welcomed Mr Haines' reappointment. She commented:

>Andrew's reappointment is very good news for consumers and for the aviation sector. Since joining the CAA he has put in place important changes to modernise the organisation and build on its strengths, to ensure we regulate as effectively as possible in what are challenging times for civil aviation. The organisation will benefit from his continued leadership in ensuring an aviation industry that is safe, delivers choice and value for consumers, and takes steps to reduce its environmental impact.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The Civil Aviation Authority is responsible for the regulation of civil aviation in the United Kingdom and is the Government's principal advisor on aviation matters. It has specific responsibility for aviation safety, consumer protection, airspace policy and the economic regulation for the industry. It is based mainly in London and Gatwick and has approximately 1000 employees.
  2. Mr Haines' salary will remain unchanged at £250,000 per annum. The CAA's funding comes from the charges it imposes on the industry, rather than the taxpayer. He holds no other public appointments.
  3. The Government published the draft Civil Aviation Bill on 23 November 2011. It includes proposals to devolve greater responsibility to the CAA as the independent specialist regulator for aviation, in particular in the economic regulation of airports and aviation security. It will also modernise the governance and financial oversight of the CAA.",12/22/2011,increasing-international-competitiveness-of-uk-airlines-and-airports,,Department for Transport,secretary-of-state-for-transport,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111128,A new era for search and rescue,"Under the plans published today, search and rescue operations at RAF Boulmer would end in 2015 and at Portland when the MCA contract expires during 2017. ","Britain is to have a new fleet of faster and more modern search and rescue helicopters, the Government has announced.

The new service will see search and rescue operations provided by contracted civilian crews and the Government has today started the procurement process for a contract lasting around ten years.

Under existing arrangements, search and rescue is provided jointly by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) - operating a fleet of Sea King helicopters from eight military bases, with a further four civilian bases operated under contract to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). The new arrangements will see the end of military involvement in a dedicated helicopter search and rescue service. This will allow the Armed Forces to focus their activity on front-line operations and enable the MoD to meet its previously announced intention to retire its fleet of Sea Kings by March 2016.

Shipping Minister Mike Penning said:

>Every day around the UK, people undertake a range of activities where knowing there's a reliable search and rescue service if something goes wrong is absolutely vital.

>The current arrangements have served us well for decades, and we are grateful to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force for their great dedication in helping deliver an exemplary search and rescue service over the years. But we cannot ignore the fact that, after their sterling service to our country, the Sea Kings are nearing the end of their life and it is time to look to the future. Commercial operations are nothing new in this area - the MCA's search and rescue functions have been provided on a contract basis for almost thirty years - and this system has served us well. This new, long-term contract will see the UK served by some of the most modern, well-equipped helicopters in the world.

Under the [plans](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/uk-sar-helicopter-services) published today, search and rescue operations at RAF Boulmer would end in 2015 and at Portland when the MCA contract expires during 2017. The winning bidder will be then be expected to operate from ten locations around the UK, but provide at least the same level of service as at present.

Today's announcement follows the cancellation of a previous search and rescue helicopter procurement in February this year. Under these former proposals, search and rescue would have been provided by a commercial operator through a Private Finance Initiative using a combination of military and civilian crews. The project was cancelled following the discovery of irregularities in the bidding process.

The Government expects to award this new contract in early 2013 to give the future service provider time to mobilise the new capability.

### Notes to editors

The [draft Civil Aviation Bill](/publications/civil-aviation-bill) will replace the current economic regulation duties of the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), with a single primary duty to promote the interests of passengers. The CAA will be given more flexibility to set performance measures at major airports, encourage investment in improvements and provide passengers and other airport users - such as those sending cargo by air - with more information about airline and airport performance.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>The end user - in this case the needs of air passengers and businesses - must be at the heart of our transport networks. Whether going on holiday, flying for business or transporting goods by air, the customer experience at airports can make or break a trip.

>By and large passengers give good feedback about airports, but they also say they want things like more seating, better information and additional baggage carousels at busy times - these are exactly the matters that the CAA will be able to address more effectively under its new powers.

>This Bill couples our commitment to make our airports better rather than bigger with the Government's wider agenda on better regulation. It also complements our ongoing work to produce a sustainable policy framework for aviation, a draft of which will be published next spring.

The draft Bill is designed to modernise the key elements of how the industry is regulated and contribute to economic growth. It also extends to aviation security, the 'user pays' principle which exists elsewhere in the sector (e.g. safety regulation). This will involve the transfer of certain aviation security functions, such as monitoring and enforcement, from central Government to the CAA which charges the industry for its activities. However, the responsibility for setting aviation security policy and making aviation security directions to the industry will remain with the Secretary of State for Transport. It is estimated that this move could save UK taxpayers over £4m a year whilst seeing a better quality service delivered.

Other measures included in the draft Bill today include:

  * Giving the CAA a role in promoting better public information on customer service and environmental impacts.
  * A switch to a new licensing regime for larger airports: licensing - which is common in many regulated industries - allows greater flexibility than the current uniform system and enables the CAA to target regulatory activity where and when it is needed to protect the interests of consumers.
  * New and streamlined appeal processes that will improve access to justice for those affected by regulatory decisions.
  * A supplementary financing duty on the CAA which will help ensure that efficient airport licence holders can finance their activities.
  * Powers for the CAA to impose a range of penalties for breaching licence conditions (going up to 10% of an airport's annual turnover) to better incentivise compliance and penalise poor performance.
  * Removing unnecessary central Government involvement and bureaucracy from the regulatory process.
  * Modernising the CAA's governance and operations.

The Government had originally announced its intention to introduce this Bill in the next session of Parliament, however an opportunity has now arisen to introduce it earlier - most likely early next year. By publishing a draft at this stage, the Government aims to give the Transport Select Committee and wider stakeholders the opportunity to consider the Bill before it is brought before Parliament.

Much of the legislation surrounding aviation dates back to the 1980s and is in need of modernisation. It is possible that the scope of the Bill may be extended before it is introduced. One area which could be included is the reform of the Air Travel Organisers' Licence (ATOL), following the recently finished consultation on measures to protect consumers better in the 21st century holiday market and help create a more level regulatory playing field for businesses.

The measures are set out in the final report by the Government's South East Airports Taskforce which has been published today. They are focused on making Heathrow more resilient and better able to recover on days when the airport's operations are disrupted by poor weather or other problems. When such problems occur, these proposals would allow, exceptionally, both Heathrow's runways to be used simultaneously for either arrivals or departures as a way to cut delays and cancellations and get punctuality back on track. 

The Taskforce also endorsed plans for a switch to a smarter, more effective and more passenger-friendly airport security regime for all UK airports - details of which have also been published today for consultation.

Set up to identify operational improvements at the UK's three busiest airports - the South East Airports Taskforce included representatives from airlines, airport operators, regulators and other interests.

Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports play a vital role in supporting the UK economy. Improving the reliability of these airports, particularly Heathrow, was a priority for the Taskforce. 

>These measures have the potential to deliver greater reliability for passengers, while reducing the impact of unscheduled night flights on local communities. Trialling these changes will allow their benefits and impacts to be assessed and there will be extensive engagement and consultation with local communities before any decision is taken on whether to make the changes permanent. 

>Coupled with today's proposals to give UK airports more flexibility in the way they deliver airport security, passengers should begin to see real improvements. I am grateful to all Taskforce members for working so constructively together to help make our airports better.

Under existing arrangements, Heathrow operates largely on a runway alternation system, whereby one runway is used for arrivals and the other for departures - with the roles reversed halfway through the day to provide respite from noise for residents living near the end of the runways. The Government has made clear its support for the continuation of runway alternation. 

Currently, BAA are permitted, under certain circumstances, to use both runways simultaneously for arrivals to clear major backlogs of flights waiting to land - a process known as Tactically Enhanced Arrival Measures (TEAM). Under the proposals put forward today, there would be more flexibility for the operator as to when these measures would be used and this approach would be extended to cover departures. 

Trials of the new measures will be run over the autumn and next summer. They will be overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority, the UK's independent aviation regulator, and will involve BAA working closely with local residents to ensure transparency, take account of their views and monitor the impact of such operations on those communities nearest the airport.

The Taskforce's proposals will now be taken forward by the airports and the Government will reconvene the group in a year's time to review the progress made. 

The Government announced its intention to change the way aviation security is regulated in October, and has today published proposals for consultation. Over recent years, the regulation of aviation security has been largely focused on a series of prescriptive security processes which airport operators are required to follow. 

Under the proposed changes, operators will instead be required to deliver a series of security outcomes. This will give them flexibility to devise more tailored, innovative and passenger-friendly processes to achieve the required outcomes. Drawing on the highly successful approach taken to aviation safety, these reforms are expected not just to maintain today's high levels of security, but to enhance them by embedding and encouraging a culture of improvement in the methods of delivering security. 

## Notes to Editors

1. The South East Airports Taskforce was formed in June 2010. Membership comprises:

  * BAA Heathrow
  * BAA Stansted
  * Gatwick Airport
  * Civil Aviation Authority
  * NATS
  * British Airways
  * Virgin Atlantic
  * easyjet
  * Ryanair
  * Air Transport Users Council (functions now transferred to CAA)
  * London First
  * Aviation Environment Federation
  * Airport Operators Association

2. The final [report](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/south-east-airports-taskforce) of the Taskforce, along with reports from the Punctuality, Delay and Resilience sub-group can be found on the DfT website. 

3. Over the course of a year Heathrow operates normally for around three hundred days ('green days'), experiences moderate disruption on around 50 days ('amber days') and severe delays on 15 days where on-the-day recovery is not possible.

4. The trial of operational freedoms at Heathrow will run in two phases. Following engagement with local communities, the first phase will run from November 2011 to February 2012, followed by a further period of public engagement to assess the impact on local communities. The second phase will run from July to September 2012, with the added benefit of providing increased resilience during the Olympic games. The measures are only to be used to recover from serious disruption, and the Government will now work with BAA and the CAA to develop a series of safeguards.

5. These tactical procedures are different from ""mixed mode"" which involves planned arrivals and departures from both runways throughout the course of the day. The Government has been clear that it remains committed to runway alternation at Heathrow.

6. Details of the [proposals](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-21) for a new outcome focused, risk-based security regime. The consultation is due to close on 7 November 2011.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110623b,ATOL overhaul underway as government plans to extend holiday scheme to millions,Up to six million extra holidays could be covered by the ATOL scheme via reform proposals forwarded for consultation by Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers.,"The biggest overhaul of financial protection for holidaymakers in more than a decade officially got underway today.  Up to six million extra holidays could be covered by the Air Travel Operators' Licence (ATOL) scheme under the reform proposals put forward for consultation by Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers.

Introduced over 40 years ago, the ATOL scheme offers financial protection for those booking a package holiday - enabling travellers to complete their holiday or receive a refund in the event of their holiday company becoming insolvent.  However, changes in the way holidays are booked since the scheme was first introduced mean there are now many holidays available which look like packages but fall outside the existing legislation, leading to confusion amongst passengers over their level of protection. 

The reforms are also intended to put the ATOL fund back on a financially sustainable basis, removing the need for the taxpayer support currently given via a government guarantee. 

Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>As we move into the busy summer period, millions of us will be heading abroad on holiday.  While the chances of a holiday company going under are thankfully very low, the impact on those affected can be significant.  Recent years have highlighted not only how important financial protection is to holidaymakers, but also the fact that the ATOL scheme is in urgent need of reform.

>We have always been clear about our commitment to modernising the ATOL scheme, and these proposals are an important step towards achieving just that.  As well as ensuring up to six million additional holidays are protected, these proposals will help steer the scheme's finances on to a more sustainable path for the future. We are also making an important step forward on the debate on delivering a wider reform of ATOL in the future.

Civil Aviation Authority Chair Dame Deidre Hutton said:

>The CAA welcomes the reform proposals because they will bring clarity for consumers and put an end to the situation where people are left unsure to what extent their holidays are protected if their company fails.  Today's announcement will empower consumers to make informed choices about their air holidays.  This is the first step in the reform of consumer financial protection and the CAA will be consulting on further proposals on the funding of protection in the autumn.

Today's consultation - which closes on 15 September - follows an announcement in February which outlined the approach the Government would take to reforming the ATOL scheme.  The proposals put forward today confirm the commitment to improve clarity for consumers and address the scheme's finances by:

  * extend the ATOL scheme to ""flight-plus"" holidays comprising a flight and other holiday component bought within two successive days; 
  * ensure everyone booking ATOL protected holidays will get a recognisable ATOL certificate confirming their rights under the scheme for refunds and repatriation should their travel company fail; 
  * helping ensure that 'agent for the consumer' businesses arranging holidays are fully aware of their legal responsibilities to consumers.

Subject to the responses received, the Government aims to respond to the consultation in the autumn, with a view to introducing the necessary legislation by January 2012 to capture the peak holiday-booking period for next summer.

The consultation also paves the way for further potential reforms to the ATOL scheme in the medium to longer term, seeking initial views to inform more detailed work to be undertaken by the Civil Aviation Authority later in the year.  Views are also being sought on potential reforms which would require primary legislation.  These could include bringing holiday sales by airlines into the scheme along with those arranged on an 'agent for the consumer' basis.

## Notes to Editors

  1. ATOL is a scheme that protects consumers on package holidays and some flights from the insolvency of their tour operator or travel agent. It is run by the Civil Aviation Authority. 
  2. In 2010 over 190,000 holidaymakers were repatriated or received full refunds when their ATOL tour operator went bust.
  3. Most businesses selling package holidays including a flight have to have an ATOL licence issued by the CAA.  Businesses pay £2.50 for each booking into a Fund that meets the costs of refunds and repatriations.    The Fund is currently operating at a deficit, and relies on a Government Guarantee, currently £42m, to access commercial borrowing facilities to meet its obligations
  4. The ATOL scheme was first put in place on a statutory basis in the early 1970s.  It was last substantially overhauled in 1995.
  5. Airlines are legally exempt from the requirement to hold an ATOL, however any package holidays they sell must still be financially protected.  A number of UK airlines have subsequently set up subsidiary companies to sell package holidays that do have an ATOL licence. 
  6. Legally, businesses are required to have an ATOL licence if they sell package holidays or certain 'flight only' tickets to customers.   Some businesses, however, do not technically 'sell' the flight element of a holiday, instead they buy it on behalf of the customer. This arrangement, referred to here as 'agent for the customer', does not require an ATOL licence.  Customers buying a flight and accommodation in this way are not therefore protected by the ATOL scheme, but may be unaware of this.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110525,Further progress on reducing ash cloud disruption,Reducing ash cloud from volcano Grimsvotn.,"The volcano Grimsvotn has currently paused its eruptions and Met Office modelling indicates that significant disruption between now and the end of the weekend is unlikely, Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 has said.

However, to help further reduce future disruption that could be caused if there are further eruptions or if the ash cloud returns to UK airspace, the Transport Secretary has held discussions 

The Transport Secretary confirmed that progress has been made in several key areas. Test aircraft are flying today to measure the density of the ash cloud, providing information to the Met Office to help refine the input data for its model. British Airways and Easyjet have also agreed to work with the CAA and the Met Office to provide information from their flights to help improve the model's input data, with the aim of reducing the 'red zone' as much as possible. Furthermore, the Transport Secretary has asked NATS and the CAA to draw up procedures to allow flights to arrive and depart from the UK beneath the ash cloud and then gain altitude once they are safely clear of the 'red zone' - a technique known as 'underflying' - should the ash cloud return at high altitude. 

Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>The new regime that we have established since last year has already significantly reduced disruption for passengers and airlines. If we still had the old regime in place, the whole of UK airspace would have been effectively closed for parts of yesterday.

>I am pleased that, following discussions with the industry and regulators today, we have agreed further steps to reduce potential disruption, should the ash cloud return. Test aircraft are now flying through the ash cloud gathering information about its density, BA and Easyjet have agreed to provide further information to help us define the 'red zone' even more accurately in the future, and key steps have been taken to establish a new 'underflying' regime for UK airports.""

Following meetings with British Airways and Easyjet, the two largest British airlines, Mr Hammond said:

>We are constantly refining our ash forecasting methods and are keen to collect as much data as possible to help with this. Yesterday, satellite and lidar readings confirmed the presence of ash over Scotland and northern England, several aircraft made reports of encounters with ash to the Met Office and ash deposits were also found on aircraft and on vehicles in Orkney.

>I welcome the support of airlines who want to help us gather further data and I am pleased that British Airways and Easyjet, as the two largest UK carriers, have agreed to participate in this process.

## Notes to editors 

### Improvements in last 12 months

In April 2010 the established aviation guidance was simply for aircraft to avoid flying in any concentrations of ash. Many steps have been taken in the past 12 months to ensure the UK is now much better prepared to deal with an ash eruption. Improvements include:

  * Installation of a new ground-based radar in Iceland which is providing accurate data on the ash plume height, the acquisition of specially adapted weather balloons for local observations and development of new satellite technology that allows the height and concentration of ash to be measured rather than just its movement. 
  * Intensive work by aircraft and engine manufacturers and regulators to better understand the effects of ash on aircraft, leading to tolerance levels being increased by a factor of 20 since April last year. 
  * A new regulatory safety regime dividing ash clouds into three zones, allowing airlines to fly in low concentrations of ash and - in conjunction with their airframe and engine manufacturers - to submit a safety case to the CAA to fly in medium and high densities of ash. 

#### Ash observations reported to the Met Office yesterday, Tuesday 24 May included:

  * A plane flying from Aberdeen to the Shetlands encountering volcanic ash during the flight with ash being deposited on the aircraft. 
  * Ash deposits found on a plane that had be flying in the Orkney area. 
  * A plane flying from Stansted to Belfast observing a layer of ash to the north /northwest of the flight path. 
  * A plane flying at a height of 18,000 feet in the Manchester area observing a layer of ash approximately 1000-2000 feet thick. 
  * Ash has been deposited on vehicles on Orkney. 
  * The research ship Discovery entered an area of thick volcanic ash on Monday between Scotland and Iceland with ash being deposited onboard. 
  * Satellite and Lidar observations confirming the presence of ash over northern Britain in the last 24 hours. 
  * Air quality sensors across Scotland indicating an increased amount of ash particles (PM10s).

Following decisions not to support new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, the Government is seeking views on the shape its future aviation policy should take and the issues it needs to address. The central theme will be how aviation can support economic growth while addressing its environmental impacts such as carbon emissions as well as local noise and air quality issues.

Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>Aviation is a crucial part of this country's transport infrastructure, it should be able to grow, prosper and support wider economic growth. But we are not prepared to support this growth at any price - the environmental impacts of flying - both local and global - must be addressed.

>However, it would be wrong to suggest that the Government holds all the answers. That is why this document asks a wide range of interested parties for their views on the key questions we face. Clearly we won't agree on everything, but by working closely with key stakeholders at this early stage, we can provide a policy framework for aviation which strikes a balance between different interests.

The Government has today published a [scoping document](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-09) setting out the key principles and challenges of a new greener aviation policy. Comments are being invited on the scoping document until the end of September. A draft aviation policy framework will then be published for consultation in March 2012, with a view to formal adoption by March 2013.

##  Notes to editors 

1. Details of the [scoping document ](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-09).
2. The new policy framework will replace the previous government's The Future of Air Transport White Paper which was published in 2003 and updated in 2006.
3. The Government's objective is to develop a long-term, high-level framework for aviation which:  
* sets out the Government's aims for aviation and the parameters within which they can be delivered;  
* takes account of the positive and negative impacts of aviation, and achieves a sustainable balance between them;   
* integrates aviation policy with wider Government objectives, including delivering sustainable economic growth, combating climate change and protecting the local environment;   
* builds consensus among those who rely on and are affected by aviation; and   
* provides industry with the clarity it needs to invest in the UK over the long term.

Dr Bell has been a member of the CAA Board since April 2006, after a career in the civil service. At the CAA, her work has included chairing the Remuneration Committee and membership of the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) price control panel. She has also played an important role in implementing the changes to the corporate governance of the CAA recommended in Sir Joseph Pilling's 2008 strategic review.

Dr Bell's time commitment to the CAA will reduce from the present two days per week to one, in line with other non-executive members of the Authority. There will be a corresponding reduction in her salary to £22,000 per annum, but with additional remuneration for chairing committees and participation in appeals hearings.

In addition to her role at the CAA, Dr Bell is a non-executive director of the United Utilities Group plc and Ensus Ltd, and has recently been appointed as a non-executive director at the Department of Health; she will receive a salary of £15,000 per annum for this role. 

She is also a governor of the London School of Economics and chair of the Investment Committee of the Civil Service Benevolent Fund; neither of these positions is remunerated.

  * The CAA is responsible for the regulation of civil aviation in the United Kingdom and is the Government's principal advisor on civil aviation matters. It has specific responsibility for aviation safety, consumer protection, airspace policy and the economic regulation of the industry. Its funding, including the salaries of Board Members, comes from the charges it makes on the industry that it regulates.
  * The decision to reappoint Dr Bell was taken in accordance with the Code of Practice published by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. All appointments are made on merit and political activity plays no part in the selection process. However, in accordance with the original Nolan recommendations, there is a requirement for appointees' political activity (if any declared) to be made public.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110203-2,Millions of extra holidays protected as Government confirms ATOL reform,ATOL gets an overhaul.,"People booking a holiday abroad are set to benefit from a clearer more extensive protection scheme after the Government confirmed it would press ahead with reforms to the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) scheme. The reforms - made necessary by changes in the holiday market - will see the ATOL scheme undergo the biggest overhaul for more than a decade. The changes are expected to ensure around 6 million more holidays receive protection.

In a statement to Parliament, the Aviation Minister, Theresa Villiers, outlined a series of changes to ATOL which the Government aims to implement by the end of the year. Subject to a Spring consultation on the details, the reforms will:

  * Extend protection to include 'flight plus' holidays. This would cover trips including a flight where the various elements are purchased within a specified short period - essentially looking like a package holiday but falling outside the existing legal definition. 
  * Deter businesses from misleading consumers about their level of protection. Some companies offer holidays which might look like packages but make the transaction as an ""agent for the customer"" without explaining to the customer that this means forfeiting ATOL protection. These proposals are designed to provide customers with a clear and honest explanation so they can make informed decisions.
  * Replace the wide variety of documents which companies currently issue with standardised information for travellers, making it clear when their trip is ATOL protected. Work on this is already underway, with the Civil Aviation Authority and the travel industry developing an easily recognisable certificate for protected holidays.

These reforms will be achieved through new regulations, existing legislation and making greater use of unfair trading rules.

In addition to ensuring the ATOL scheme is better suited to the modern holiday market, the proposals will also help to reduce the deficit in the fund which covers refunds and repatriation in the event of insolvency. Following a number of high-profile collapses in recent years, the Air Travel Trust Fund (ATTF) relies on a Government guarantee, currently worth £42m, and Ministers see the reduction of this as very important.

Theresa Villiers said:

>Since it was introduced, ATOL has provided protection for millions of holiday makers and I am determined to see this continue. Insolvencies in recent years have shown us how important it is that customers are able to buy protected holidays, but recent court cases have only served to highlight the fact that the scheme is in need of reform. These changes will remove much of the confusion surrounding ATOL, while ensuring operators who offer such holidays provide customers with the financial protection they expect. 

>As well as improving protection for passengers, these reforms will help us put ATTF finances back on track so that taxpayers' exposure to the fund's deficit is rapidly reduced and ultimately eliminated.

>I also believe there may be a case for new primary legislation to address other issues in the ATOL scheme and I will be considering this further in the course of the year.""

##  Notes to editors 

  * ATOL is a scheme that protects consumers on package holidays and some flights from the insolvency of their tour operator or travel agent. It is run by the Civil Aviation Authority.In the past 12 months, 43,637 holidaymakers were repatriated under the scheme and a further 132,820 received full refunds when their ATOL tour operator went bust.

Over 30 million holiday flights depart from the UK each year, with very few holiday-makers ever affected by a travel company failure.  The Government is actively considering how to ensure the ATOL holiday protection scheme remains relevant to today's travel market and expects to outline its decision soon.

Aviation Minister, Theresa Villiers, said:

>While the vast majority of holidays pass without any problems, we have recently seen the anxiety and difficulty the failure of a travel operator can cause. 

>Today's holiday market works in such a variety of ways, it can be very difficult to know whether and how your trip might be covered. This is why we are taking the need to update the ATOL scheme very seriously.

>We are working right now on what can be done to make the scheme better suited to today's holiday industry and improve the clarity of the scheme so passengers are fully aware of whether they're covered or not. 

>In the meantime, anyone who wants to protect their money should look at the information on the DirectGov website and do their homework before booking their holiday.

Under the ATOL scheme, travellers who book package holidays are entitled to a refund if they have not already travelled, or are brought home free of charge if abroad at the time of insolvency.  Those who are not ATOL-protected can take other steps to help protect their trips, such as taking out specific travel insurance or booking with a credit card.   These options are all explained on the DirectGov website.

The package of measures is designed to put passengers at the heart of how airports are run, encourage competition between airports and promote investment which will make Britain's major airports better, not bigger.

Under the plans - which will reform the framework for regulating airports - the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), will be given a new primary duty to promote the interests of passengers. The CAA will also be given a supplementary financing duty - helping to drive passenger focused investment. It will also be granted new and more effective powers to take action against airports that underperform and new powers to investigate and take action against anti-competitive behaviour.

The proposals would also see a switch to a new regulatory licensing regime. This will allow regulation to be tailored to meet the requirements of individual airports, rather than the same conditions being applied to all regulated airports. This will enable the CAA to better target regulatory activity where and when it is needed to protect the interests of consumers.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>The way our airports are regulated is in urgent need of reform. The current economic regulation legislation dates from 1986, when the aviation sector looked very different from today.

>We must now put passengers at the heart of how our airports are run. We have already announced that we do not support the building of new runways at Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted. We want to make those airports better, not bigger and that is exactly what these measures will do.

>These changes will help drive passenger-focused investment in airports - such as in new baggage handling equipment or building new modern facilities - and they will also allow economic regulation to be used in a more targeted way and remove unnecessary bureaucracy.

After careful consideration, the Government has decided not to give a new remit to Passenger Focus to represent air passengers as had previously been proposed. The Government believes that it is important to have strong passenger representation but that this is not the time to be make additional structural changes which will add to the regulatory burden on industry. It will therefore be exploring options for strengthening existing passenger representation arrangements.

The Government announced in the Queen's Speech its intention to reform the framework for the economic regulation of airports. The Government plans to bring forward legislation to implement these reforms as soon as Parliamentary time allows.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The CAA currently has four duties for the purposes of economic regulation, they are:  
- to further the reasonable interests of users of airports within the UK, users being defined (in section 82 of the Airports Act) as airlines, passengers and other user of air transport services at the airport;  
- to promote the efficient, economic and profitable operation of such airports ;  
- to encourage investment in new facilities at airports in time to satisfy anticipated demands by the users of such airports; and  
- to impose the minimum restrictions that are consistent with the performance by the CAA of its functions under those sections.  
In addition, the CAA also is also required to take account of international obligations.
  * These duties will be replaced with a single primary duty and a number of supplementary duties. These will be set out in full in future legislation.
  * Licensing: The proposals see a new licensing regime to be applicable only to airports with substantial market power and where such regulation adds real value. This is presently expected to apply initially to Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. The current regulatory regime is set out in statute with limited powers for the CAA to address changes in market conditions over time and take account of the requirements of individual airport.
  * Competition Powers: The proposals will provide the CAA, in line with other regulators, concurrent powers with the Office of Fair Trading giving the option, where appropriate, to respond to anti-competitive behaviour using competition law powers rather than by applying regulatory tools. This will enable the CAA to investigate and remedy anti-competitive behaviour in the provision of airport services at airports, and where appropriate refer markets to the Competition Commission for investigation.
  * The Government will not be making changes to the basis on which the current price caps at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are set.

It will be made up of key players from the aviation world and chaired by Aviation Minister Theresa Villiers, with the initial focus on Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.

Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>This marks the start of a new chapter in our aviation policy.  I have a clear vision for our airports which sees greater reliability, shorter queues, less hassle and better services for passengers.  It is absolutely crucial that we get this right as aviation is vital to our national economy.

>We have been clear in our opposition to additional runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, so the challenge we face now is making them better within existing runway capacity constraints.  Working together with key partners within the aviation community, this group will look at how to secure the successful future of aviation in the Southeast and Heathrow's hub status within the constraints of the existing runways. 

>Our vision is for better not bigger airports, with new investment targeting improvements in reliability and passenger experience. 

The group features representatives from airlines, airports, passenger groups, business, environmental groups and other industry bodies such as the Civil Aviation Authority and NATS.

Today's announcement complements the Government's separate commitment in the Queen's Speech to reform the economic regulation of UK airports, which should help to drive investment in existing airport facilities and improve performance to benefit passengers.

Most EU states charge lorries for using their roads which means that British vehicles have to pay to drive in Europe, while foreign lorries can drive for free in the UK.

Mike Penning said:

>We want to ensure that UK hauliers get a fairer deal and help maintain the competitiveness of our logistics industry.

>Each year there are around 1.5 million trips to the UK by foreign registered lorries - but none of them pays to use our roads, leaving UK businesses and taxpayers to foot the bill.

>The proposals I have set out today will ensure that all hauliers who use our roads are contributing to their cost, regardless of where they are from.

>I want UK hauliers to get involved and respond to this consultation to make sure that the final scheme works for them - helping level the playing field with foreign hauliers, boosting their market share and increasing employment and promoting growth in the UK.

The proposed scheme will levy a time-based charge of around £10 a day for lorries of 12 tonnes or over using any road in the UK. The precise level of charges will depend on exchange rate and inflation at the time of implementation - likely to be 2015, subject to the legislative programme.

By law, the scheme cannot discriminate between UK-registered vehicles and vehicles from elsewhere in the EU so this charge will apply to all lorries but, for the vast majority of UK hauliers, this will not mean an increase in costs because the Government proposes to compensate them for the charge.

The most likely compensation measure will be a reduction in Vehicle Excise Duty for UK-registered vehicles.

For 94% of UK-registered HGVs over 12 tonnes, hauliers would not pay any more than now. Four per cent would pay no more than £50 a year more and a further 2% would pay slightly over £50, but the maximum extra cost would be £79. Even these small increases could be avoided by most vehicles if they were replated to carry a slightly reduced weight.

Under the plans, UK hauliers would pay an annual (or six month) charge for each HGV at the same time and in the same transaction as they pay its Vehicle Excise Duty. Foreign hauliers could pay daily, weekly, monthly or annual charges.

The consultation will run until 18 April 2012 and can be found here: [http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-03/](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-03/)

### Notes to Editors

  1. The lorry road user charge would apply to heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) of 12 tonnes and over. There are seven proposed main charge bands applying to most HGVs. These charge bands align with existing Vehicle Excise Duty bands for these vehicles. Both the charge and Vehicle Excise Duty are intended to reflect the different levels of damage caused to the road by the vehicle. The charges for each band are set out in the table below:  

VED band User charge rate: (foreign vehicles only) User charge rate (foreign and UK vehicles)

| Daily | Weekly | Monthly | Annual |
| A | £1.70 | £4.25 | £8.50 | £85 |
| B | £2.10 | £5.25 | £10.50 | £105 |
| C | £4.80 | £12 | £24 | £240 |
| D | £7 | £17.50 | £35 | £350 |
| E | £10 | £32 | £64 | £640 |
| F | £10 | £40.50 | £81 | £810 |
| G | £10 | £50 | £100 | £1,000 |

Information on some additional charge rates applying to a few other types of freight-carrying HGVs are included in the consultation document.

  2. The charging levels must comply with the Eurovignette Directive (Directive 1999/62/EC as amended by 2006/38/EC and 2011/76/EU) which sets out a framework of rules for tolls and charges, including maximum daily rates for the latter.
  3. Non-payment of the user charge would be a criminal offence, which could result in a fine imposed by the courts of up to £1,000. The user charge would be enforced by DVLA records, ANPR cameras and checks by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) at the roadside. VOSA would also be able to issue fixed penalties on the spot to non-compliant drivers (and take financial deposits from drivers based outside the UK).
  4. Most EU states charge lorries for using their roads e.g. a vehicle doing a two-day return trip from the UK to Belgium, Luxembourg orthe Netherlands pays 16 Euros in user charges.",1/25/2012,providing-effective-regulation-of-freight-transport,,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,

Following consultation on proposals to allow a two metre increase in the length of articulated lorries, the Department for Transport is allowing a ten-year trial of up to 900 trailers at an increased length of 2.05 metres, and 900 at an increase of one metre. The longer lorries will operate within the existing weight limit of 44 tonnes.

The trial is expected to provide a £33m boost to the haulage industry as the longer vehicles provide up to 13% more loading space - allowing fewer journeys to transport the same amount of goods - without compromising safety.

Mike Penning said:

>The road haulage industry is vital to the growth of our economy. By allowing companies to use one truck where they may have previously needed to send two, we can help the sector improve efficiency and save money - which should in turn benefit consumers.

>Independent research showed the potential environmental, safety and congestion benefits of longer trailers and this voluntary trial will give industry the opportunity to demonstrate how this works in practice.

>The trial will be subject to rigorous annual assessments and will be closely and independently monitored throughout so that any concerns are addressed quickly.

The consultation responses indicated that haulage operators would like the option to choose between different trailer lengths depending on the type of operation they are carrying out.

The changes would make the total permitted length for articulated lorries 18.55 metres; the current maximum length for lorries using a truck and drawbar trailer is 18.75 metres. The Government has ruled out any further increase in length.

The response to the [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-06).

**Notes to Editors:**

  1. Current UK regulations limit the maximum loading length of semi-trailers to 13.6 metres. Under the trial, the Department will be permitting the limited use of semi-trailers with a maximum loading length up to 15.65 metres. This is the same loading length currently allowed for rigid truck / drawbar trailer combination vehicles.
  2. The maximum permitted length of articulated lorries drawing the longer semi-trailers will be 18.55 metres. This compares to 18.75 metres for the rigid truck / drawbar trailer combination vehicles mentioned above.
  3. The Government is not permitting any increase in the current maximum gross vehicle weight of 44 tonnes. It has also ruled out the introduction of ""gigaliners"" - lorry combinations of 25 metres and above.
  4. The Government had also consulted on the possibility of increasing the length of cabs to allow a more aerodynamic frontal design. However, it was clear from the consultation that there is unlikely to be significant commercial demand for aerodynamic frontal designs at present. The Government therefore does not intend to take this any further at this time, but will keep the situation under review.

HS2 Ltd, the independent company set up to deliver a high speed rail network between London and the North of England, has now moved from an advisory role to become a delivery body. The main role of HS2 Ltd in the development of this project will be to undertake work and provide the advice which enables the Department to deposit a hybrid Bill with Parliament by the end of 2013.

The following appointments have been made: 

**Richard Brown** has held high level positions in and around the rail sector. Through his association with HS1 and Eurostar, he brings experience of the specification and delivery of major rail infrastructure, and ensuring longer term value for money. He is also able to add further value through his experience of running an operational high speed railway.

**Godric Smith** is currently Director of Government Communications for London 2012. From 2006 to 2011 he was Director of Communications for the Olympic Delivery Authority. He worked at Downing Street for 10 years from 1996-2006 including as the Prime Minister's Official Spokesman from 2001-2004.

**Duncan Sutherland** has undertaken a number of senior development roles working with Local Authorities; as Director of City Development in Coventry, and as Chief Executive of the property and investment arm of the City of Edinburgh Council. For the last 12 years, he has worked with Local Authorities and developers to realise large scale, long term regeneration projects. He will advise and challenge the senior executive to ensure the widest possible receipt of benefits.

**Mike Welton** has been re-appointed to the Board. During his early career he was part of Department's design and construction management team for the M3 and M25. He returned to the private sector and led, from senior executive positions, many large civil engineering projects, including the London Underground Jubilee Line tunnels and stations. He retired from his position as Group Chief Executive of Balfour Beatty in 2004, to follow a non-executive career.

Duncan Sutherland is also appointed by Scottish Ministers as a Non Executive Board Director of the Scottish Canals Board.

As Non-Executive Directors, their primary responsibilities will be to ensure that:

  1. the Department requirements, laid out in the Sponsor's Requirement and Project Development Agreement, are adhered to throughout development;
  2. the performance and conduct of management in meeting agreed milestones, including the preparation of annual reports and annual accounts and other statutory duties is monitored effectively;
  3. high standards of corporate governance are observed, including high standards of probity in line with both best practice and statutory requirements;
  4. the executive function is provided with advice and challenge in all areas affecting development;
  5. stakeholder relationships with partnership organisations are developed and improved.

The Board will be based in HS2 Ltd's offices in central London. Non-Executive Directors of HS2 Ltd receive a per diem of £950, and are expected to commit 2 days per month to the business of HS2 Ltd.

Public appointments are made for a period of 3-5 years, however re-appointment is possible, if mutually agreed, to a maximum engagement of 10 years. It is necessary to ensure that the Board has continuity, by staggering appointments:

Godric and Duncan have been appointed for 3 years. Godric will take up his post in October, on conclusion of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Richard and Mike have been appointed for 5 years, as they will provide advice and challenge on the preparations for construction following Royal Assent for the hybrid Bill in 2015.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>HS2 is an absolutely vital project that will rebalance our economy and provide the only viable solution to the looming capacity crunch on our rail network. The Board of HS2 Ltd has an important role to play in ensuring successful delivery of the scheme and getting the best outcome for taxpayers. Mike, Godric, Richard and Duncan bring with them a breadth and depth of experience in delivering major projects, which will be invaluable as we press ahead with HS2.

Richard Brown said:

>I am delighted to take up this appointment. This is a fantastically important project for the country, and I will work to ensure that we deliver a project that is not simply a design marvel but also, in the longer term, a successful operational railway.

Duncan Sutherland said:

>I am very happy to be joining the Board of HS2 Ltd. This is a vital project for the country and I will work to ensure that the regenerative benefits, and opportunities for long term, large scale development, are maximised across the high speed rail network.

Godric Smith said:

>High speed rail has an important part to play in helping modernise our national infrastructure, renew our railways and promote growth. I look forward to making a contribution to the development of HS2 over the next three years.

Mike Welton said:

>I am very pleased to have been asked to remain in my position on the Board of HS2 Ltd. I will continue to work to deliver this project, to ensure that our transport infrastructure is fit to meet our needs for the future, addressing the very real problems affecting capacity, while securing the best value for money for the taxpayer.

HS2 will be a Y-shaped rail network with stations in London, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and the East Midlands linked by high speed trains conveying up to 26,000 people each hour at speeds of up to 250mph.

High speed trains will also connect seamlessly with the existing West Coast and East Coast main lines to serve passengers beyond the HS2 network in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle, Durham, York, Darlington, Liverpool, Preston, Wigan and Lancaster.

It will be built in two phases. The first will see construction of a new 140 mile line between London and Birmingham by 2026, the detailed route of which is published today. The second phase will see lines built from Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester by 2033. A formal consultation on second phase routes will begin in early 2014 with a final route chosen by the end of 2014.

The first phase of HS2 will include a connection to Europe via the Channel Tunnel. On completion of HS2 the network will include a direct link to Heathrow Airport. 

Key points:

  * HS2 will increase dramatically passenger capacity along the key transport corridors of Britain with up to 26,000 extra passenger seats running each hour that will relieve congestion on existing intercity routes as well as roads and air routes.
  * HS2 will mean very ubstantial time savings between Britain's cities, reducing a Birmingham to Leeds journey from 2 hours to just 57 minutes and a Manchester to London journey from 2 hours 8 minutes to only 1 hour 8 minutes. Birmingham to London journeys will be almost halved from 1 hour 24 minutes to 45 minutes, 4 minutes less than the fastest 49 minute service featured in the consultation.
  * Even cities and towns off the HS2 network - like Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Preston, Wigan, Lancaster, Newcastle, Darlington, York and Durham - will be served by high speed trains able to use both HS2 and existing intercity lines seamlessly to save up to an hour on journeys to London. HS2 will effectively act as a rail ""motorway"" network offering greater capacity and speed while not restricting train services to stations on the HS2 network.
  * There are no credible alternatives to a new railway line. Network Rail has judged that alternative packages of rail upgrades and improvement on existing lines are no substitute to the long-term and sustainable capacity increase that HS2 provides.
  * A high speed line will deliver £6.2bn more of economic benefits than a line running at conventional speed - and around £3.5 more revenues - at a cost of only £3bn more than building a conventional speed equivalent. HS2 will cost a total of £32.7bn.
  * The benefit cost ratio (including wider economic benefits) for HS2 is £1.80-2.50 benefits for every £1 spent on the cost of the project. The BCR has been revised downwards slightly due to the current economic climate but remains convincing.
  * A commitment to reducing the effects of HS2 will see 79 miles of the 140-mile line between London and Birmingham running in tunnels or cuttings. The 22.5 miles in tunnel announced today is a 55% increase in the amount of tunnelling in the consultation route.
  * HS2 runs through 13 miles of the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) but fresh mitigation measures announced today mean that less than two miles will be at or above surface level.
  * HS2 will benefit rail, road and air users. It will free up capacity on existing rail routes for more commuter, regional and freight services. It will take an estimated 9m journeys off the road network and cut up to 4.5m air journeys each year.
  * HS2 trains will be up to 400 metres long with 1,100 seats, travelling at speeds of up to 250mph. Double decker trains could be introduced to run on the HS2 network and would be compatible with HS1 and the Channel Tunnel. Services using HS2 and existing rail lines will use standard-size non-double decker high speed trains.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said: 

>A new high speed rail network will provide Britain with the additional train seats, connections and speed to stay ahead of the congestion challenge and help create jobs, growth and prosperity for the entire country.

>HS2 will link some of our greatest cities - and high speed trains will connect with our existing railway lines to provide seamless journeys to destinations far beyond it. This is a truly British network that will serve far more than the cities directly on the line.

>HS2 will deliver up to 26,000 more seats for rail passengers each hour and journey times slashed by as much as half. By attracting passengers off existing rail lines, roads and domestic air services, its benefits will be felt far beyond the network. No amount of tinkering with our Victorian rail infrastructure will deliver this leap in capacity.
 
>It is not a decision that I have taken lightly or without great consideration of the impact on those who are affected by the route from London to Birmingham. I took more time to make this decision in order to find additional mitigation which now means more than half the entire 140-mile line will be out of sight in tunnels or cuttings. I am certain this strikes the right balance between the reasonable concerns of people living on or near the line, who will be offered a generous compensation package, and the need to keep Britain moving.
 
>More than a century ago the Victorians built railways that continue to serve us to this day and just over 50 years ago the post-war generation chose to invest in motorways, bringing higher road capacity and faster journeys to millions. Both transformed the economic and social fabric of this country: HS2 is our generation's investment in Britain and our children.

Confirmation that the new network will be built follows one of the largest public consultation exercises ever undertaken, which set out both a high level plan for a complete network and a detailed route for a first phase from London to Birmingham.  Today, Transport Secretary Justine Greening has unveiled a package of alterations to the proposed London to Birmingham route to help ensure the lowest possible impacts on local communities and the environment. These include: 

  * A longer, continuous tunnel from Little Missenden to the M25 through the Chilterns
  * A new 2.75 mile (4.4 km) bored tunnel along the Northolt Corridor to avoid major works to the Chilterns Line and impacts on local communities in the Ruislip area. 
  * A longer green tunnel past Chipping Warden and Aston Le Walls, and to curve the route to avoid a cluster of important heritage sites around Edgcote
  * A longer green tunnel to reduce impacts around Wendover, and an extension to the green tunnel at South Heath.

The net result of the changes means that:

  * around 22.5 miles of the route will be completely enclosed in tunnel or green tunnel - compared to 14.5 miles for the consultation route;
  * around 56.5 miles will be in cutting - significantly reducing the visual and noise impact of the line;
  * around 40 miles will be on viaduct or embankment - around 10 miles less than the consultation route.

There will be significant improvements for those living near the route, specifically:

  * Fewer than five properties will experience high levels of noise 
  * Only 60 dwellings will experience noise levels sufficiently high to qualify for statutory noise insulation, compared to 150 for the consultation route - a reduction of over 50% 
  * The number of properties that would experience a noticeable increase in noise would be reduced by a third, from 4,700 to around 3,100 
  * There will be four fewer residential demolitions than the route that went for consultation and there would be far fewer dwellings at risk of land take - reducing from 342 to 172 

The network will be built in two phases with the line from London to Birmingham expected to open in 2026 with the onward legs to Manchester and Leeds opening in 2032-33. The Government estimates the cost of the complete 'Y' shaped network at £32bn and expects it to generate benefits of £47bn and fare revenues of up to £34 billion over a 60-year period. 

The Department is writing to all those whose homes may be affected by the new railway and has today also announced a new package of measures to help those affected by the scheme. These include:

  * The introduction of a streamlined purchase scheme to simplify the statutory blight process for property owners
  * A sale and rent back scheme to give homeowners in the safeguarded areas more flexibility 
  * The introduction of a streamlined small claims scheme for construction damage which will allow individuals and businesses who are entitled to compensation under existing law to claim it more quickly and simply
  * A Package of measures to reinforce confidence in properties above tunnels
  * A refreshed hardship scheme

## Notes to Editors

**Economic Case**

  * The cost of constructing a Y shaped network linking London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, as well as the Channel Tunnel and Heathrow, is estimated to be £32 billion. 
  * Over a 60-year period, HS2 Ltd's analysis estimates that a national high speed rail network would generate benefits with a net present value of up to £47-59 billion. The net present cost to Government over the same period of building and operating the line would be £24-26 billion.
  * On this basis, the Government's assessment is that the proposed network would have a benefit:cost ratio of between 1.8 and 2.5. 

**The Government's proposed route**

  * The Government's proposed network would be built in phases.  Phase 1 will comprise an initial London-Birmingham line including a direct link to High Speed One (HS1). This will run from a rebuilt Euston station to a new Birmingham City Centre station at Curzon Street. A Crossrail interchange station will be built at Old Oak Common in West London, providing direct connections to: the West End, City and Docklands via Crossrail; to the South West and Wales via the Great Western Main line; and to Heathrow via the Heathrow Express. 
  * A second interchange station will be constructed where the line of route passes the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) and Birmingham Airport close to Junction 6 of the M42. It will offer direct links to Birmingham Airport, the National Exhibition Centre and the M6 and M42. A direct link to HS1 will be provided in tunnel from Old Oak Common to the existing North London Line, from where existing infrastructure can be used to reach the HS1 line north of St Pancras.
  * Phase 2 will see the new high speed line running on to Manchester and separately to Leeds. HS2 Ltd is currently engaged in detailed planning work for options for these routes, including stations in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire, as well as for a spur link to Heathrow. Connections onto the existing West and East Coast main lines will also be included, allowing direct high speed train services to be operated to cities including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Liverpool, Preston, Lancaster, York, Durham and Darlington. Further consideration will also be given to extending the network subsequently to these and other major destinations.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110729,High Speed rail consultation draws to a close,HS2 public consultation closes Friday 29 July.,"People wishing to have their say on the Government's proposals for a high speed rail network have until the end of today (Friday 29 July) to register their views as one of the biggest consultation exercises ever undertaken by Government reaches its conclusion.

Since it was launched at the end of February, the consultation process has included a series of 31 public roadshows held over 41 days along the proposed line of route, regional seminars for business and civic leaders across the UK and information stands at stations across England and Scotland.  Information was provided on all aspects of the scheme ranging from the economic case to property concerns and the impact on the environment.  Almost 30,000 people attended the events where they were able to quiz engineers and experts from HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport.

Over the coming months, responses to the consultation will be carefully analysed before the Transport Secretary makes a decision on whether to proceed with the scheme towards the end of the year.

Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, said:

>High speed rail has the potential to transform the economic map of our country, create jobs, drive regeneration and deliver the additional rail capacity we so badly need.  However I also understand the concerns of those who will be directly affected by the proposals, which is why we have done everything possible to allow people to find out about the scheme and to have their say.  I am grateful to all who have taken the time to contribute to the consultation and their views will form a vital part of the process as we move towards a decision later this year.

If the decision is taken to build a line from London to the West Midlands, the next stage would be for the Government to introduce a hybrid Bill which would set out the land requirements for the first phase of the project and provide the necessary legal powers to build and operate the new railway.  Before such a bill could be introduced to Parliament, work would be required to complete the next stage of engineering design, including more detailed design of the route, its structures and mitigation measures.  This process would also see the production of a full Environmental Impact Assessment and would be done in consultation with local communities and relevant authorities to agree mitigation measures.

Should the decision be taken to proceed with a high speed line, the drafting of a hybrid Bill would be likely to take until autumn 2013, when it would be deposited in Parliament. Parliamentary process could then be expected to take about one and a half years with a view to gaining Royal Assent in early 2015.  Following a period of preparation, construction would then take approximately eight years, with testing of the line beginning in 2024 and the London to West Midlands line opening in early 2026. 

The Government would expect to announce and consult on its proposed route and station locations for the second phase of the project - the legs from the West Midlands to Manchester and Leeds - over the next few years.  This would be with a view to introducing a second hybrid Bill in the next Parliament.

## Notes to Editors

**Economic case**

  * The cost of constructing a Y shaped network linking London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, as well as the Channel Tunnel and Heathrow, is estimated to be £32 billion (in 2009 prices).
  * Over a 60-year period, HS2 Ltd's analysis estimates that a national high speed rail network would generate benefits with a net present value of £44 billion. The net present cost to Government over the same period of building and operating the line would be £17 billion (calculated as total capital and operating costs of £44 billion less fares revenues of £27 billion).
  * On this basis, the Government's assessment is that the proposed network would have a benefit:cost ratio (BCR) of 2.6. The basis on which this BCR has been calculated is explained in more detail in the _Economic Case for HS2_, which is available on the consultation website. However, it does not include the significant strategic benefits relating to high speed rail's potential for supporting: job creation, regeneration and economic growth. 

**Consultation details**

  * The [consultation](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk) on the Government's high speed rail proposals closes at midnight tonight, Friday 29 July. 
  * A full suite of detailed supporting documents, including the economic case for high speed rail and a full Appraisal of Sustainability is also available on the website.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110401,Huge increase in commuter trains possible with HS2 - Hammond ,"More services avialable with high speed rail, says Transport Secretary.","Many towns and cities could benefit from a huge rise in direct trains to London once a new high speed rail network is built, Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 told business and civic leaders from across London and the South East today.

With intercity services transferring to a new high speed line, significant extra space would become available on the existing network, meaning towns such as Milton Keynes, Northampton and Rugby could become much better connected to London. 

The Department for Transport and HS2 Ltd have already established that an extra 11 services could be run on the West Coast Main Line every hour once the first phase of HS2 is built from London to the West Midlands. Completion of the second phase to Manchester and Leeds could deliver similar improvements for commuter locations on the East Coast Main Line such as Luton, Bedford and Stevenage.

Mr Hammond also announced that an industry-led group, headed by Passenger Focus and Network Rail, would be established to investigate how best to use the extra capacity. 

Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>Our proposed new high speed rail network would free up a huge amount of space on the current railways for more trains to operate. Building a whole new line would create scope for people who live on the current lines to have more frequent services that are less crowded - I would also hope that this additional competition could mean cheaper fares as well.

>The reality is that many of our current trains are full and too many people have to stand - we desperately need the extra trains and capacity that a new high speed rail network would bring.

>By bringing in the expertise of Passenger Focus and Network Rail at this early stage in the process, we can ensure that best possible use would be made of this new capacity, and I would like to thank them in advance for their work on this very important project.

The Department for Transport estimates the cost of the complete 'Y' shaped high speed network at £32bn and expects it to generate economic benefits of around £44bn and fare revenues of around £27bn over a 60-year period. 

The proposed network would be delivered in two phases - the first a line from London to the West Midlands and linked to the HS1 line to the Channel Tunnel, and the second the onward legs to Manchester and Leeds. The second phase would also include a direct link to Heathrow, bringing Sheffield and Leeds within an hour and a quarter of the country's major hub airport.

The Government is currently holding a public consultation on its proposals for high speed rail which runs until 29th July 2011.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110228,Investing in Britain's future: High speed rail consultation launched ,Launch of consultation on the Government's proposals for high speed rail.,"Britain's economic map would be redrawn, jobs created, prosperity spread and the way businesses work and compete transformed by a new high speed rail network, Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said today as he launched a consultation on the Government's proposals.

Launching one of the biggest public consultations ever undertaken, the Transport Secretary also warned that Britain's transport network cannot afford to be left behind while competitor countries improve their transport infrastructure.

The Government is proposing a 'Y' shaped network linking London, the West Midlands, Manchester and Leeds, with stations in South Yorkshire and the East Midlands, and links to existing lines to enable through-running services to other cities including Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh. The scheme would deliver around £44bn of benefits and would cut journey times between London and other major cities by as much as an hour.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>We must invest in Britain's future. High speed rail offers us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform the way we travel in the 21st century and would help us build a modern economy fit for the future. 

>Countries across Europe and Asia are already pressing ahead with ambitious plans for high speed rail, while some of our key rail arteries are getting ever closer to capacity. We cannot afford to be left behind - investing in high speed rail now is vital to the prosperity of future generations.

The Government believes a new high speed rail network would offer:

  * A better connected Britain: Bringing Birmingham within 49 minutes of London, and Manchester and Leeds within 80 minutes or less. Birmingham and Manchester would be less than 50 minutes apart and Leeds and Birmingham just over an hour. Travel from London to Scotland's major cities would take around 3 hours 30 minutes. Running 14 or more trains per hour, each with up to 1,100 seats and offering much higher levels of reliability than the existing network, high speed rail could shift as many as 6 million air trips and 9 million road trips a year on to rail.
  * A foundation for growth, jobs, prosperity and regeneration: The increased speed, capacity and connectivity provided by a high speed rail network would reshape our economic geography, regenerate our urban centres and help to bridge the north-south divide that has held us back in the past, allowing Britain to build a modern economy fit for the future.
  * A new start for Britain's existing rail network: With long-distance services transferred to the new high speed network, large amounts of space would be freed up on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines, allowing for an expansion of commuter, regional and freight services on these lines.

The Government estimates the cost of the complete 'Y' shaped network at £32bn and expects it to generate economic benefits of around £44bn and fare revenues of around £27bn over a 60-year period. The proposed network would be delivered in two phases - the first a line from London to the West Midlands, and the second the onward legs to Manchester and Leeds.

A direct link to Britain's existing high speed line, High Speed 1 - which runs from London St Pancras to the Channel Tunnel - is also proposed as part of the initial phase of the scheme, to allow travel from cities linked to the high speed network to the continent. Construction of a direct link to Heathrow airport - which, under the proposals, would be built at the same time as lines from Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester - would enable direct high speed services to run to and from the airport, providing an attractive alternative to many short-haul air journeys and bringing central Birmingham within an hour of Heathrow, and Manchester and Leeds within around 70 and 75 minutes respectively.

In December 2010, the Government announced its proposed route for the first phase of a high speed line between London and the West Midlands. The consultation which begins today is both on that proposed route and the Government's strategy for a wider network. The consultation will run until 29 July and events will take place in towns and cities along the 140-mile proposed route between London and the West Midlands, as well as in major cities across the country. 

Subject to the outcome of this consultation, the Government intends to secure powers to deliver each phase of its proposed high speed network by means of the hybrid bill process. Construction of any new network would be expected to begin early in the next parliament, with the line to the West Midlands completed by 2026 and the legs to Manchester and Leeds finished in 2032-2033.

##  Notes to editors 

### Economic case

  * The cost of constructing a Y-shaped network linking London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, as well as the Channel Tunnel and Heathrow, is estimated to be £32 billion (in 2009 prices).
  * Over a 60-year period, HS2 Ltd's analysis estimates that a national high speed rail network would generate benefits with a net present value of £43.7 billion. The net present cost to Government over the same period of building and operating the line would be £17.1 billion (calculated as total capital and operating costs of £44.3 billion less fares revenues of £27.2 billion).
  * On this basis, the Government's assessment is that the proposed network would have a benefit:cost ratio of 2.6. The basis on which this BCR has been calculated is explained in more detail in the **Economic Case for HS2**, which is available on the consultation website. However, it does not include the significant strategic benefits relating to high speed rail's potential for supporting: job creation, regeneration and economic growth. 

### Environmental mitigation

  * The Government is clear that high speed lines must be designed sensitively and include mitigation measures to ensure any impacts are reduced to the minimum. The Appraisal of Sustainability prepared for the proposed London-West Midlands line shows that the improvements delivered through sensitive design and mitigation can be significant.
  * Following the Secretary of State's autumn visits to the proposed line of route, work to review and refine its recommended alignment by HS2 Ltd has seen changes to around 50 per cent, including moving it away from sensitive sites and settlements, and lowering the line and using green bridges and tunnels to reduce noise and visual impacts.
  * Along with additional work to assess opportunities for noise mitigation, this has contributed to the number of properties which would be expected to experience high noise levels reducing from 350 (in HS2 Ltd's original report to Government) to around 10.
  * In the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), all but 1.2 miles would be either in tunnel, in cutting and/or alongside the A413 main road.
  * If the proposed line is taken forward, then an Environmental Impact Assessment would be carried out as part of the preparations for the process of seeking powers. 
  * Any high speed route proposals for subsequent lines from the West Midlands to Manchester or Leeds will be subject to public consultation in due course, and Appraisals of Sustainability would be prepared and published to inform those processes.

### Consultation details

  * The [consultation](http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk) on the Government's high speed rail proposals runs until 29 July
  * A full suite of detailed supporting documents, including the economic case for high speed rail and a full appraisal of sustainability is also available on the website.
  * In the coming months, roadshows will be held along the proposed London-West Midlands line of route. You can see the full timetable of events on the consultation website.

### The Government's proposed route

  * The Government's proposed network would be built in phases. Phase 1 would comprise an initial London-Birmingham line including a direct link to High Speed One (HS1).

A Crossrail interchange station would be built at Old Oak Common in West London, providing direct connections to: the West End, City and Docklands via Crossrail; to the South West and Wales via the Great Western Main Line; and to Heathrow via the Heathrow Express. 
  * A second interchange station would be constructed where the line of the route passes the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) and Birmingham Airport close to Junction 6 of the M42. It would offer direct links to Birmingham Airport, the National Exhibition Centre and the M6 and M42. A direct link to HS1 would be provided in tunnel from Old Oak Common to the existing North London Line, from where existing infrastructure can be used to reach the HS1 line north of St Pancras.
  * Phase 2 would see the new high speed line running on to Manchester and separately to Leeds. HS2 Ltd is currently engaged in detailed planning work for options for these routes, including stations in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire, as well as for a spur link to Heathrow. Connections on to the existing West and East Coast main lines would also be included, allowing direct high speed train services to be operated to cities including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Liverpool. Further consideration will also be given to extending the network subsequently to these and other major destinations.

### Blight and Compensation

  * Under existing planning law, qualifying property owners of land within the safeguarded area for any future high speed line would have access to statutory blight provisions. These provisions would likely take effect at such time as safeguarding directions were issued in respect of any route. 
  * Once any future high speed line had been open for a year, property owners would also be eligible to claim statutory compensation under Part 1 of the Land Compensation Act 1973.
  * The Government is considering what additional measures may be appropriate to help those whose properties were unlikely to need to be compulsorily purchased in order to build a new line, but who may still experience a significant loss in the value of their property as a result of its proximity. Further details are provided at Annex A in the consultation document.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101220,New high speed rail proposals unveiled,Proposed high speed rail network will include a direct link to Heathrow ,"Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, today confirmed that the Government's proposed high speed rail network - which would link London to the West Midlands, Manchester and Leeds - will include a direct link to Heathrow and to the European high speed rail network.

Mr Hammond also published details of the Government's proposed route for the first phase of the project, a new line between London and Birmingham. After visiting the route and consulting with local people, Mr Hammond today revealed that the proposed route has been significantly redrawn to incorporate changes to over half its length.

The completed Y-shaped network would bring the West Midlands within about half an hour of London and would allow journey times of around 80 minutes from Leeds and Manchester to the capital. Connections onto existing tracks would also be included, allowing direct high speed train services to be operated to cities including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Liverpool.

A direct link to Britain's existing high speed line, High Speed 1 - which runs from London St Pancras to the channel tunnel - would allow travel from cities along the new high speed line to the continent, while construction of a direct link to Heathrow airport - to be built at the same time as the lines to Leeds and Manchester - would enable direct high speed services to run to and from the airport, providing an attractive alternative for many short-haul air journeys. In addition, the released capacity on the West Coast Mainline would offer the possibility of more frequent, fast commuter services from places such as Milton Keynes and Coventry.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>High speed rail is so important because it has the potential to transform the way Britain works and competes in the 21st century. Political and business leaders from across the country are clear that a rail network of this kind has huge potential to reshape our economic geography for the better.

>But I also know there will be less welcome impacts of this new line in some parts of the countryside. Since taking this job I have reviewed all the possible route options in detail as well as travelling the length of the proposed line to talk directly to local people. As a result, I have made a number of changes to the route published by the previous Government. The route I am publishing today differs from the previous one for around 65 out of the 127 miles of its length.

>We are continuing to look at additional mitigation measures to lessen the impact of the line on those communities which it passes nearest to, as well as considering innovative options for providing assistance to those who may be affected by the proposed line. I hope the communities affected will play a full part in the consultation process.

Since his appointment as Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 has visited the full length of the proposed route for a new London to Birmingham line, meeting local residents and MPs. As a result, he commissioned significant additional work to reduce the line's local impacts and this has resulted in changes to the proposed route. Maps of the new route have been published today and full public consultation on the route - as well as on the Government's broader strategy on high speed rail - will begin in February 2011. Significant improvements to the route previously published have been made, including at the following locations: 

  * At Primrose Hill in London, where work to identify the most appropriate locations for the necessary vent shafts has shifted the proposed tunnel, and the vent shafts themselves, to the north, locating them alongside the existing railway.
  * Between Amersham and Wendover, where a green bridge and a green tunnel have been incorporated into the route design to reduce its visual impact and avoid severance of public rights of way.
  * At Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire, where by moving the alignment away from this historic property, HS2 Ltd have been able to ensure that the line would not be visible from the House itself and that additional earthworks and planting can be undertaken to further reduce its visual and noise impacts.
  * At Edgcote House to the north of Aylesbury, where HS2 Ltd have made adjustments which move the proposed line further away from the property and its gardens, without increasing its impact on nearby villages.
  * At Lichfield where an improved alignment would move the line further from the city, whilst avoiding any increased impact on other local communities.

The Government proposes to secure the powers to deliver the high speed network by means of a Hybrid Bill. Depending on the outcome of consultation and Parliamentary timescales and approval, enabling works for the initial London-Birmingham phase should be able to begin in 2015 with the high speed network opening in phases from 2026.

## Notes to Editors

  * The Government's proposed route for the London-Birmingham line will run from a rebuilt Euston station to a new Birmingham City Centre station at Fazeley Street. A Crossrail interchange station would be built at Old Oak Common in West London, giving the new line direct connections to the West End, City and Docklands via Crossrail, to the South West via the Great Western main line and to Heathrow via the Heathrow Express. A second interchange station could also be located to the south east of Birmingham - offering direct links to Birmingham Airport, the National Exhibition Centre and the M6 and M42. 
  * To provide the direct link to High Speed One (HS1), a tunnel would be dug from Old Oak Common to the existing North London Line near Chalk Farm, from where existing infrastructure can be used to reach the HS1 line north of St Pancras.
  * Further work has been commissioned from HS2 Ltd to develop more detailed route proposals for the Heathrow spur, however this is expected to broadly follow the M25 corridor south from the main London-Birmingham line before accessing the airport. The final route proposal is expected to be subject to public consultation later this Parliament alongside the routes for the proposed Manchester and Leeds legs.
  * The Department for Transport is today publishing [detailed maps of its proposed route](http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/highspeedrail/proposedroute/) and other supportive documentation. 
  * After Birmingham, the Government's proposed strategy would see the new high speed line running on to Manchester and separately to Leeds. HS2 Ltd is currently engaged in detailed planning work for these routes, including options for serving the East Midlands and South Yorkshire.
  * Connections onto existing tracks would also be included, allowing direct high speed train services to be operated to cities including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Liverpool. Further consideration will also be given to extending the network subsequently to these and other major destinations. 
  * Under existing planning law, eligible property owners directly affected by any confirmed plans for the development of any future high speed line have access in due course to statutory blight provisions. These provisions would come into force at such time as safeguarding directions are issued in respect of any route. 
  * However, the possibility of such a line being constructed may in some cases have an impact on property values in the period before statutory protection is available. Therefore the Government has introduced an [Exceptional hardship scheme](http://www.hs2.org.uk/exceptional-hardship-scheme?pageid=1) for householders most affected by these proposals, and in particular for householders who have an urgent need to relocate.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101105,UK Government sells right to operate first High Speed Railway ,Canadian consortia to run High Speed 1.,"The successful bidder in a sale of the concession to run Britain's first high speed railway, High Speed 1, was announced today by Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, as a consortium comprising Borealis Infrastructure and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. The consortium will pay the Government a total concession value of £2.1bn to operate the line for the next 30 years in a sale which will help reduce the UK's record debt and provide opportunities for new services on the line.

The consortium will take on the management of the 68 mile line which links London to the Channel Tunnel following completion later this month. The consortium will be responsible for running the line as well as stations such as St Pancras International, and the international stations at Stratford, Ashford and Ebbsfleet. 

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said: 

>This is great news for taxpayers and rail passengers alike. It is a big vote of confidence in UK plc and a big vote of market confidence in the future of high speed rail. It also shows that the decisive action this Government has taken to reduce the deficit is already paying dividends and that investors believe once again that Britain is open for business. 

>The £2.1 billion receipt exceeds the highest expectations for the sale and will make a welcome contribution to reducing the deficit.

>I look forward to working with the new concessionaire and to the benefits passengers will see as High Speed 1 seeks to attract new services to the line, allowing British passengers to travel by high speed train to even more destinations across Europe. 

>This is an exciting time for rail travel and an important step in our plans to develop a truly national and international high speed network for British travellers.

The successful sale was managed for the Government by London and Continental Railways (LRC) Ltd. Commenting on today's announcement, LCR Chief Executive, Mark Bayley, said: 

>High Speed 1 is a unique, high quality infrastructure asset which speeds tens of thousands of people between London, Kent and continental Europe every day. I am very proud to have been associated with the business and its excellent management, and believe that we have achieved an extremely good price for HS1 through a very competitive process.

High Speed 1 is currently used by international Eurostar services between London and European destinations as well as domestic high speed services between London and Kent. The performance of the new operator of the line will be independently policed by the Office of Rail Regulation to ensure that rail passengers' interests are effectively safeguarded. The Government began a competition for rights to run the line in June 2010.

UBS acted as financial adviser to LCR on the sale of HS1. Citi advised DfT in relation to the sale.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The winning bidder becomes the owner of HS1 Limited which has a 30 year concession to run the High Speed 1 line and stations. HS1 is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of London and Continental Railways which is, in turn, owned by the Secretary of State for Transport. As part of the general financial restructuring undertaken in summer 2009 the then Secretary of State entered into a long-term Concession with HS1 to manage and operate the High Speed 1 railway between London and the Channel Tunnel. 
  * HS1 receives revenues from track access charges paid by train companies using the line including Eurostar, which operates services between London and Paris, Brussels and other European cities, and Southeastern Trains, which operates domestic high speed services. Deutsche Bahn has also recently announced its intention to commence running high speed trains from London to Frankfurt via Brussels and Cologne as well as to Amsterdam in 2013.
  * The Secretary of State for Transport will continue to own the infrastructure of the railway and the freehold to the associated land. HS1 will have the rights under the Concession to sell access to track and stations on a commercial basis. It will have to preserve the nature and capacity of High Speed 1 as a high-speed railway and to maintain and renew it to modern standards. 
  * The performance of HS1 under the Concession will be independently policed by the Office of Rail Regulation. After 30 years, the current Concession will cease and the Government will once again enjoy unencumbered ownership of the assets, with the potential to re-let a further Concession.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101004-2,Proposed high speed rail network north of Birmingham confirmed ,Consultation on strategic roll-out of High Speed Rail network and preferred route between London and Birmingham.,"Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, has today announced which network option the Government prefers for taking high speed rail north of Birmingham.

The Government will consult early next year on building a Y-shaped high speed rail network with separate legs from the West Midlands to each of Manchester and Leeds. A Y-shaped route would allow the East Midlands and South Yorkshire to be served by the high speed rail network, as well as Leeds, Manchester and the North West.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>We have committed to a high speed rail network that will change the social and economic geography of Britain; connecting our great population centres and our international gateways; transforming the way Britain works as profoundly as the coming of the original railways did in the mid-19th century.

>So we will consult in the New Year on the strategic roll-out of a High Speed Rail network and on our preferred route for the first leg between London and Birmingham.

>But I can announce today that the Government's preferred option for High Speed Rail north of Birmingham will be for two separate corridors. One direct to Manchester, and then connecting on to the West Coast Mainline, and the other via the East Midlands and South Yorkshire - with stations in both areas - before connecting to the East Coast Mainline north of Leeds. The so-called ""Y"" option.

>Giving us High Speed Rail connectivity - not just between London and Birmingham, but onwards to Leeds and Manchester. A strategic project that will make rail the mode of choice for most inter-city journeys within the UK, and for many beyond.

Mr Hammond has been considering advice from HS2 Ltd - the Government company set up to examine the case for high speed rail - on the relative benefits of the 'Y' route against a 'reverse S' shaped route from Birmingham to Manchester and then across the Pennines to Leeds. HS2 Ltd found that the Y network would deliver a total of £25 billion more benefits than the reverse S.

HS2 Ltd published detailed route proposals for a high speed rail line from London to Birmingham earlier this year. Work is currently underway to refine the preferred route identified in that report and the Secretary of State will set out the Government's final preferred route for consultation later this year.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The Government has concluded that the Y-route would offer greater relative benefits than the alternative 'reverse S' route option. These include: 
    * faster journey times to Leeds and the North East;
    * ability to serve additional markets such as East Midlands and South Yorkshire;
    * over 40,000 more trips daily; and
    * the ability to generate far greater released capacity on the Midland and East Coast main lines, benefiting commuter and regional markets.
  * The Y-option also has a stronger business case, stemming from both higher projected transport benefits (around £15 billion greater) and revenue (around £10 billion greater).
  * The chosen network option will be included in the consultation on the Government's strategy for high speed rail, planned for the early part of 2011. And subject to the outcome of this consultation and further detailed work by HS2 Ltd, there would then be a detailed consultation on the line of route for Leeds and Manchester.

The sale will help raise funds for the public purse as well as creating better opportunities for new rail services to new destinations to run on the line.

From today, bidders interested in running the 68 mile line - which links London to the Channel Tunnel - as well as stations such as St Pancras International, Stratford, Ashford and Ebbsfleet are being invited to come forward. The successful bidder will become the owner of HS1 Ltd which has a 30 year concession to run the line and stations.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>High Speed 1 is a national success story and a world class railway operating to international standards. The money generated by this sale will make an early significant contribution to the crucial task of reducing the public sector debt.

>That's good news for the taxpayer. But the sale will also bring benefits to passengers as the successful private bidder will be incentivised to attract new operators serving new routes.  

>This is part of the Government's approach to making our national assets - and every taxpayer pound - work harder. The Government does not have to run everything directly - we need to take prompt action where private enterprise can provide both a better deal and a superior service to the public.

High Speed 1 is currently used by international Eurostar services between London and European destinations as well as domestic high speed services between London and Kent. Following the sale, the performance of HS1 Ltd will be independently policed by the Office of Rail Regulation to ensure that rail passengers' interests are effectively safeguarded.

HS2 Ltd - the company set up to develop plans for a high speed rail network - have now moved from an advisory role to become a delivery body. The main role of HS2 Ltd in the development of this project will be to undertake work and provide the advice which enables the Department to deposit a hybrid Bill with Parliament by the end of 2013. It is essential that the team leading HS2 Ltd has the right skills for the new role.

In particular, a Chair and a number of Non-Executive Directors for the Board of HS2 Ltd will be sought as Public Appointments. The Department will also be conducting a Chief Executive appointment process.

The advert for the Chair role is now open and will close on 8 February. The recruitment of the remaining roles will follow shortly afterwards, in order that the Chair can be appropriately involved in their appointment. The CEO and Non-Executive Director roles will be advertised from 13 February to 9 March 2012.

HS2 Ltd will also continue to develop route options for Phase 2 of the project, including lines from the West Midlands to Leeds and Manchester, and a spur to Heathrow. This will include engineering design work, and appraisals of sustainability. HS2 Ltd will also prepare materials and provide advice to develop and inform future consultations.

The New Generation Transport scheme, delivering the UK's first modern electric trolleybus system, will receive the bulk of the funding (up to £173.5 million) from the Department for Transport with the remainder (£76.5 million) coming from local authorities. The project has today been granted ""programme entry status"" by the Department for Transport allowing Metro (West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive) to apply for the statutory consents necessary for the scheme. Subject to these being granted work will start in 2016 with the trolleybus fully operational in 2018.

Commenting on her decision, Justine Greening said:

>Leeds will have new state-of-the-art trolleybuses that will be faster, more reliable and greener than their predecessors. They will make public transport in Leeds more accessible and attractive than ever before and I know trolleybuses will be transformational for growth and jobs in West Yorkshire.

>Investment on this scale in precisely this kind of infrastructure is a recognition of how crucial Leeds and Yorkshire are to the long-term success of the British economy. It is also a great example of what this coalition government and West Yorkshire partners can achieve when we knuckle down together and stick at finding a real solution to today's challenges.

When the trolleybus system is completed it will run from Holt Park in the north to Stourton in the south, linking with two Park-and-Ride sites. The trolleybus will operate in exclusive designated road lanes along more than 40 per cent of its 8.7 mile length.

## Notes to Editors

  1. In addition to the trolleybus, the Department is funding: two new railway stations at Kirkstall Forge and Apperley Bridge; the A65 Quality Bus Corridor, which will be completed shortly; and a new southern pedestrian entrance to Leeds railway station.
  2. The Leeds New Generation Trolleybus is the first modern trolleybus proposal in the UK although they are commonplace in Europe. A trolleybus has many features of a tram - overhead wires, similar vehicle quality - but does not run on rails and so is cheaper and faster to construct.

The funding forms the third allocation from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. [12 major projects have won funding totalling £225 million, while 15 smaller schemes are receiving a total of £41 million](/publications/local-sustainable-transport-fund-guidance-on-the-application-process/) from the Department for Transport. This includes an additional £40 million on top of the previously- announced £560m funding available under the scheme.

This central funding will be matched by a further £194 million funding from local authorities and businesses, bringing the total value of the schemes to £460 million. Since the Local Sustainable Transport Fund was created following the General Election of 2010, almost a hundred schemes have benefitted from more than £1 billion.

The schemes announced today are led by 24 local authorities, with many more as partners and cover eight regions.

Each of the projects will provide a transport package that delivers carbon savings and economic growth, and in many cases will see major investment in local transport infrastructure.

The successful schemes include a variety of measures including improving sustainable transport options for commuters, encouraging parents and children to walk to school, creating public transport hubs and building better cycling infrastructure.

Norman Baker said:

> ""The schemes we are funding will improve life for millions of people in towns and cities up and down the country and show that cutting carbon and boosting economic growth go hand-in-hand.
> 
> ""Investing in these schemes shows that we are serious about funding infrastructure where there is a clear business case for doing so. The money we are putting into these projects will unlock much greater economic benefits for communities as well as improving the environment - it's a win-win.""

The schemes to be funded include:

  * Reading will see a real boost for bikes, including a London-style cycle hire scheme and a new state-of-the-art pedestrian and cycle bridge crossing the Thames. There will also be new park-and-ride schemes and improvements to existing schemes to help commuters access key employment hubs.
  * Merseyside will see a project providing better public transport and cycle infrastructure, linking areas of deprivation with areas of employment. The scheme will include real-time travel information and extra services for bus users as well as station improvements on the local rail network.
  * Nottingham will see its smartcard scheme expanded to cover all of the city's buses, trams and trains with more outlets offering top up services for the cards. The funding will also cover cycle storage and hire schemes, as well as a network of local travel hubs set up to address the specific travel needs of different communities.

A full list of the successful bids can be found below. All the schemes for which funding has been confirmed today are also receiving significant contributions from the local council or the private sector.

These local schemes will bring national benefits. In addition to supporting economic growth, enabling and encouraging people to make more sustainable travel choices, the projects will reduce delays on the roads in urban areas, which cost the economy around £11 billion a year. These projects will help tackle problems such as poor air quality, and improved cycling and walking infrastructure will help to improve the health of the nation.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120517a,Revolutionary new Tram Trains to be piloted in South Yorkshire,Passengers in South Yorkshire will be the first in the country to benefit from flexible new Tram Trains that will make their journeys easier.,"Passengers in South Yorkshire will be the first in the country to benefit from flexible new Tram Trains that will make their journeys easier and more convenient.

Transport Minister Norman Baker today gave the green light to a £58m pilot scheme to run revolutionary Tram Trains on both rail and tram networks, making them ideal for the eight mile non-stop journeys of no more than 25 minutes between, suburb and city centres from Sheffield to Rotherham.

As well as providing a boost to the regional economy thanks to improved connections across the region, the project is also expected to create 35 new jobs locally as well.

As part of the major works being undertaken to make the project a reality includes the electrification of a stretch of track between Sheffield and Rotherham and the construction of 400 metre line linking the tramway to the train tracks.

Norman Baker said:

>Providing better connections between Sheffield and Rotherham's city centres and residential areas will help to reinvigorate the local economy. It will also encourage people to leave their cars at home, making this pilot environmentally friendly.

>This is great news for passengers in South Yorkshire and potentially it could benefit people across the country wherever tram and rail networks exist together.

>Tram Trains have already proven hugely popular on the Continent. Now we will be able to test whether they can bridge the gap between tram and train networks in this country.""

Welcoming the announcement, David Brown, SYPTE's Director General, said:

>We welcome the announcement today by the Minister confirming approval of the funding for the Sheffield /Rotherham tram train project. It is further welcome investment by government in the transport infrastructure of South Yorkshire. The project will provide important enhanced local connectivity and demonstrate the potential, both locally and nationally, of this new technology to deliver value for money services.

For the pilot to go ahead, rail infrastructure operator Network Rail will electrify a stretch of track between Sheffield and Rotherham.

Phil Verster, route managing director for Network Rail, said:

>Tram Trains offer a real opportunity to improve transport links in urban areas and today's announcement of funding is extremely welcome.

>We have already learned a significant amount about how a Tram Train could benefit Britain's rail network. Now we can move into detailed design and delivery of the infrastructure to support this exciting project which will bring lasting benefits to passengers in the Sheffield and Rotherham areas.

Northern Rail's Managing Director Ian Bevan said:

>We are working with our partners to pilot Tram Trains on the network as we believe these vehicles can complement heavy rail, particularly in outer urban and semi-rural areas around major cities with an existing tram network. There are lessons to be learned here and Northern cities are among those well placed to benefit from them.

Margaret Kay, Managing Director of Stagecoach Supertram, said:

>We welcome today's announcement and look forward to playing an important role in this pilot. Tram Trains offer us the potential to deliver greener, smarter public transport services to even more people. We have a strong track record of providing high quality, good value services to the people of Sheffield day in, day out and we are excited at the prospect of being able to expand our services even further through this ground-breaking project.

If the pilot is successful, it opens the way for Tram Trains to be introduced in other parts of the country.

Councillor Andrew Fender, Chair of the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee, said:

>We'll be watching Sheffield's Tram Train pilot very closely as we have begun work to understand whether this technology could be deployed within Greater Manchester. Tram Train could combine the advantages of the better access to the city centre our Metrolink tram system provides with the reach of the rail system into neighbouring districts. It has the potential to both improve public transport for passengers while also making our local rail services more cost-effective.

The new Tram Train vehicles will operate from 2015 on Sheffield's Supertram network and on part of the national rail network, which will be adapted to allow seamless travel from one to the other.

There are expected to be three services an hour all day and every day. These will operate from Parkgate Retail Park in Rotherham travelling through Rotherham Central Station and joining up to the existing Supertram network at Meadowhall where the services will then continue onwards to Sheffield City Centre.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The Tram Train pilot is a partnership between the Department for Transport and Network Rail, Northern Rail Ltd, South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) and Stagecoach Supertram. SYPTE will lead on delivery of the pilot.
  2. Seven vehicles are being bought for Tram Train and the additional Sheffield Supertram capacity announced in 2011. The total project is estimated to cost £58 million.
  3. A procurement competition led by Northern in 2009-10 identified Vossloh as the lead bidder for the supply of the Tram Train vehicles. Because Northern's franchise ends before the two year experimental period, the contract for the vehicles will be let by South Yorkshire PTE and the vehicles are expected to be operated by Stagecoach Supertram.
  4. Tram Train will commence in 2015 and the pilot will run for two years with a view to permanent operation. Tickets will be fully integrated with Supertram.
  5. The core objectives of the Tram Train pilot are to: 
    * Understand the changes to industry costs of operating a lighter weight vehicle with track brakes on the national rail network;
    * Determine changes to technical standards required both to allow inter-running of lightweight tram vehicles with heavy rail passenger and freight traffic and to gain the maximum cost benefit from Tram Train operation;
    * Gauge passenger perception and acceptability of Tram Train;
    * Determine the practical and operational issues of extending Tram Trains from the national rail network to on-street running; and
    * Understand the technical and operational challenges involved in this project so that the concept can potentially be rolled out elsewhere.
  6. A Tram Train vehicle is based on a tram that has been enhanced to make it suitable for operation on the main line as a train as well as street running. Typically a tram train will have: 
    * Higher vehicle crashworthiness to allow for the higher average speed operations of it and other trains and to resist slow speed collisions with heavier trains;
    * Enhancements to the signalling system to minimise the risk of a collision between trains and Tram Trains. This involves installing train protection and warning system (TPWS) at all signals, whereas TPWS is currently installed at junctions and sites with high levels of signal passed at danger (SPAD) incidents;
    * Road Traffic Act compliant head lights and direction indicators for on-street operation and to meet rail main line lighting requirements for visibility;
    * Additional main line signalling and communications equipment such as TPWS and the Global System for Mobile Communication - Railway (GSM-R);
    * More seating than a tram for longer distance journeys;
    * A wheel profile suitable for both tramway and standard main line track.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120326b,Major package of reforms to increase passenger numbers,"Thanks to a series of changes commuters and bus passengers across England will see better buses, more innovative services, and greater value for money.","Commuters and bus passengers across England will see better buses, more innovative services, and greater value for money. This is thanks to a series of changes announced today by Local Transport Minister Norman Baker.

These changes will help encourage more people to travel by bus, helping to cut congestion and carbon emissions. It will also give greater control to transport authorities in dealing with bus issues at a local level.

The latest reforms include:

  * New regulations to ensure healthy competition between bus companies. This is in response to the Competition Commission report in to the local bus market;
  * Support to local authorities in delivering effective, innovative public transport services for local communities through the Bus Service Operators Grant; and
  * An extra £15 million to help increase investment in smart ticketing equipment, particularly among small and medium-sized bus companies.

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>My vision is for a bus service that is reliable, flexible, offers competitive prices, smarter ticketing and provides passengers with a service they want to use time and again. Hard on the heels of the announcement of over £100 million of new funding for better and greener buses, today I have agreed an additional £15 million for smart ticketing. By devolving funding to local authorities it now gives them the power to tackle local issues on the ground and develop practical solutions to community problems.

>This cannot be a one size fits all approach. Each local bus market has its own issues and challenges. The focus over the coming months is on guiding, empowering and encouraging local partners to be efficient, innovative and creative in coming up with solutions to the transport needs of local people.

The new proposals are a response to the need to reform bus subsidy (Bus Service Operators Grant) and the recently concluded Competition Commission investigation into the bus market. Having worked closely with bus operators, local councils, Local Government Association, the Passenger Transport Executive Group, the Confederation for Passenger Transport and the Community Transport Association, there are several changes being brought in:

  * Subsidy payments: a proportion of these will now be devolved to local authorities, rather than paid to bus companies. The government recognises that every area has their own travel issues and transport needs. It will now be up to authorities to decide how this money is spent;
  * Competition barriers: will be eliminated and new regulations developed to prevent anti-competitive practices by bus operators. The Department will work closely with local councils to offer guidance on developing reasonably-priced tickets that can be used on any bus; and
  * Smart ticketing: we are providing an extra £15 million to operators of local bus services that do not have smart ticketing equipment installed on their buses. This will help meet the aim that by 2014, the majority of journeys by public transport be made using a smartcard.

  2. [Further details on the policy paper](/publications/green-light-for-buses/)
  3. Bus Service Operators Grant: the Local Transport White Paper (19 January 2011) committed the Department to agree smarter ways to deliver Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG), including taking into account any conclusions from the Competition Commission's review of the bus market, by March 2012.
  4. The rate at which Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) is paid will be reduced by 20% from 1 April 2012 due to the 2010 Spending Review.
  5. BSOG was introduced as fuel duty rebate in 1964 and at present is paid directly to bus operators. The amount each operator receives is based on how much fuel their vehicles use.
  6. The Government also proposes to tighten the rules that determine which bus services receive subsidy so that it goes to truly local bus services and to exclude services such as rail replacement buses.
  7. The [Competition Commission's report into the local bus market](http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/our-work/local-bus-services/final-report-and-appendices-glossary) is available.
  8. The [Government's response to the Commission's report](http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/business-law/competition-matters/market-studies) is available.
  9. Following consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government, we intend to make regulatory changes that will remove the barriers facing bus companies in England (outside London) and Wales that attempt to engage in competition on new bus routes and in new bus markets.
  10. The Department is also developing with bus companies and local transport authorities guidance on developing reasonably-priced tickets that can be used on any bus, not just on those of a single company.
  11. If the guidance does not achieve change, the Department may need to legislate to bring about more multi-operator ticketing schemes and so, in consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government. The Department intends to explore by the end of this parliament opportunities to bring forward primary legislation to give local transport authorities more powers.
  12. Smart ticketing: The Department is committed to delivering, with operators and public sector bodies, the infrastructure to enable most public transport journeys to be undertaken using smart ticketing technology by December 2014.

Today's announcement will see:

  * £31 million spent on 439 low-carbon buses, part of the Government's Green Bus Fund which aims to bring down fuel emission and air pollution levels and encourage bus operators and local councils to make the switch to hybrid-electric, fully electric or gas buses.
  * Winning local authorities across England will also receive a share of £70 million under the Better Bus Area (BBA) fund to boost growth, improve partnerships with bus companies and increase bus passenger numbers.

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>This funding means a better deal for passengers and encourages more people to travel by bus. It updates and improves services and infrastructure, reduces congestion, gives quieter journeys and with the introduction of new carbon friendly buses, reduces fuel costs and CO2 emissions, creating a greener network.

The £70 million will be shared between 24 local authorities who have impressed the Department with their bid for funding. They will benefit from up to £5 million each. This will support a range of targeted improvements including:

  * smarter multi-operator tickets
  * traffic lights that can help buses beat the queue
  * real time information; and
  * improvements to shelters and stops

Following a two month bidding process the department has also provided funding for 439 new eco-friendly buses for 2012/2013. Passengers will see 128 single-decked and 311 double-decker buses in service from spring 2013, saving over 9,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per year. The 26 bus operators including Stagecoach, Arriva and First are receiving more than £22 million, with more than £8 million split between five local authorities.

Five bus manufacturers will benefit from orders for their eco-friendly hybrid, electric and gas buses. They comprise: Volvo, Wrightbus, Optare, MAN and Alexander Dennis Limited, all of which are based in, or partly in, the UK.

By switching to low-carbon buses, the winners will also be eligible to claim additional government subsidy through the Bus Service Operators Grant to run these buses. Bus operators and local authorities will be given six pence per kilometre to support them with operational costs.

The £128m scheme will also deliver a new fleet of trams to run on the extended route.

Norman Baker said:

>This scheme will bring trams back to the heart of Birmingham, which is great news for both the city itself and the wider West Midlands. It will provide a new, sustainable transport choice for those wishing to reach the city centre's bustling shopping streets and the emerging business district in Snow Hill.

>The scheme will also cut carbon and create growth by getting more people on to public transport, create 1,300 new jobs and deliver a £50m boost to the local economy.

The Department for Transport will provide £75.4m towards the £128 million cost of the scheme which is being led by Centro, the region's transport authority, in partnership with Birmingham City Council and the Black Country district authorities.

Today's decision gives final approval for Centro to forge ahead and sign contracts for the new fleet of trams, a bigger maintenance depot at Wednesbury and for the construction of the city centre extension.

Centro chief executive Geoff Inskip said:

>We are delighted to get the final go-ahead from Treasury and Ministers.

>Norman Baker has been a great advocate for this project and we will waste no time in pressing ahead with the construction of the extension which, together with the rebuilding of New Street Station, will transform our public transport network.

>Today's announcement is marvellous news for passengers and represents a further shot in the arm for the Birmingham and Black Country economy.

The investment is in addition to the £560m Local Sustainable Transport Fund announced in January 2011. This additional funding, heavily geared towards cycling, will support jobs, enhance access to employment and encourage greater use of more environmentally friendly transport.

Sustrans - the UK transport charity - will receive £8m for projects to enhance cycle routes across England. The remaining £7m will be allocated through the Cycle Rail Working Group - the body which brings together representatives of the rail industry and the cycling sector - to improve integration between cycle and rail at stations. Measures will include safer and more convenient cycle racks, additional cycle parking and storage, and better access for cyclists. This will complement the £7m that Network Rail is already spending in this area.

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>This fund underlines the firm commitment of the Coalition Government to sustainable transport.

>If we are serious about reducing carbon, then we need to get more people walking and cycling. But we must do it in a way that boosts the economy.

>I want this fund to support projects that create growth and tackle climate change by cutting our carbon emissions.

>I look forward to seeing the projects put forward by Sustrans and the Cycle Rail Working Group and working with them to deliver transport that is greener, healthier and improves quality of life in our communities.

Both organisations will now work up the specific projects they intend to fund. The successful projects will be announced in March.

## Notes to editors

  1. The Traffic Commissioners are appointed by the Secretary of State as statutorily independent Licensing Authorities responsible for bus, coach and goods vehicle operators and for local bus service registrations. They can also take disciplinary action against the licence of bus, coach and lorry drivers who commit road and certain other offences.
  2. Prohibition notices can be issued by The Vehicle Operator and Services Agency following an inspection and can prevent a vehicle from being driven until it is roadworthy.
  3. Traffic Commissioners have the power to revoke, suspend or curtail a company's licence to operate buses, coaches and lorries if they are satisfied that a company is failing to ensure that its vehicles are maintained in a fit and serviceable condition when being operated on public roads. They can also take such action if they are satisfied that a company has failed to honour certain Statements of Intent made when they applied for their operator's licence (i.e. that vehicles would be kept fit and serviceable and that the laws relating to the driving and operation of vehicles used under the licence would be observed).
  4. Action can also be taken against PSV operators who fail to operate local bus services properly or in contravention of the registered particulars. Traffic Commissioners have the power to cancel or restrict local services an operator may run, or impose a fine if services have not been operated, or operated improperly, to a significant extent.
  5. Nick Denton joined the Civil Service in 1985, after a short spell in teaching. In a varied career, he has worked as private secretary to the Leader of the House of Commons, drafted road safety directives on secondment to the European Commission, negotiated single market transport legislation as the UK's transport attache at UKREP Brussels and also negotiated air traffic rights. More recently, he spent three years in Montreal as the UK's permanent representative on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
  6. Kevin Rooney joined the Civil Service in 1987 working initially in the Department for Transport's Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office before moving to VOSA in 1990. During his time in VOSA he ran VOSA's South West Region before taking up post in 1999 as Head of Enforcement Policy where he transformed VOSA's approach. This included the introduction of new roadside technology, the operator risk rating system and roadside financial penalties.

The scheme - the fourth in the country - will give St Helens Borough Council more powers to coordinate road works and take tough action when they overrun. It will allow the council to require anyone carrying out road works to apply for a permit in advance and to set conditions on timing, coordination or the amount of road space to be left available to road users during the works. Those companies who break the terms of their permit or work without a permit will have to pay a fine.

Norman Baker said:

>Road works are a fact of life but sometimes works take longer and cause more disruption than is necessary. This means frustrating diversions and delays for drivers, cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians, and costs business time and money.

>The approval of the new permit scheme for St Helens will give the council greater control over how works are carried out on its roads, as well as incentivising utility firms to give greater consideration to the travelling public.

>St Helens is the fourth council to gain approval for a permit scheme. Kent County Council, Northamptonshire County Council and London councils had their schemes approved in the last two years. These councils will be monitoring their schemes to make sure that they are producing benefits for local residents and feeding this information back to the Department for Transport.

## Notes to Editors

  1. St Helens Borough Council is the first English local authority in the North West to have its application for a street works permit scheme approved by the Government as meeting the requirements of the Traffic Management Act 2004 and The Traffic Management Permit Scheme (England) Regulations 2007.
  2. St Helens Borough Council has been asked to nominate its preferred date for its permit scheme to come into effect. DfT officials will work with the Council to give effect to the scheme on that date, by means of a Statutory Instrument.
  3. A council running a permit scheme is able to charge companies for providing a permit although any charge should cover costs and should not result in a surplus. It will be a criminal offence to work without a permit. The maximum fine will be £5,000. It will be an offence to not meet a permit condition, for which the maximum fine is £2,500. Fixed Penalty Notices, as an alternative enforcement mechanism, can also be given for working without a permit or not meeting a permit condition. Councils in England have been able to apply to the Department for Transport to run their own street works permit schemes since the relevant Regulations came into force in April 2008.
  4. St Helens Borough Council is responsible for the details of its scheme, and the timetable for its introduction.
  5. Permit schemes are already in place in Kent, London and Northamptonshire.",12/22/2011,improving-local-transport,,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--30,

The Department for Transport will provide funding of up to a maximum of £371m towards the total maximum scheme cost of £570m.

The two extensions will to go to Chilwell/Beeston and Clifton, linking directly into Line One at Nottingham Station. 

Today's decision will allow Nottingham City Council to complete the remaining contractual steps so that construction can begin in January. 

Norman Baker said: 

>I am delighted that we are able to finally approve funding so that construction of Phase Two of the tram system can begin.

>Line One of the Nottingham tram has proved to be a great success in encouraging people onto public transport. These extensions provide the opportunity to build on that success, and give people in the south of Nottingham quicker, more convenient access to the city centre as well as providing an alternative means of accessing the city centre for people commuting by car.

>They will also help to regenerate sections of the city and support the Government's wider growth agenda by providing better access to local jobs, and our environmental priority of cutting carbon by encouraging modal shift.

>This good news follows on from the Government's recent announcement to fund the widening of the A453, which will feed into a 1000 space NET Park & Ride site on the edge of Clifton further speeding up people's journeys between the M1 and Nottingham

Councillor Jane Urquhart, Portfolio Holder for Planning and Transportation at Nottingham City Council, the scheme's promoter, said: 

> After ten years in planning and development, alongside the innovation of the Workplace Parking Levy - our ambitious proposals to add two more lines to our tram network will now be realised

>This is fantastic news for Nottingham. In these constrained financial and economic times it means a significant boost to the local economy, more jobs and better public transport for thousands of people.

Nottingham City Council can now finalise the contract so that construction work can begin.

## Notes to Editors

This is in addition to the 20 schemes, worth £574m, which were announced in the Autumn Statement at the end of last month.

All the projects have been through a stringent assessment process to ensure they offer value for money and are affordable for both the Government and the local area.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>Transport infrastructure is central to growth, and I am announcing funding for a further 21 local major transport schemes. Along with the schemes announced last month we've supported investment of over £1.4bn that will strengthen local economies and improve local transport links for communities across the country.

>Almost all journeys begin and end on local authority networks, which provide the crucial links that allow people and businesses to prosper. We are investing in schemes that will provide better access to jobs and services, reduce congestion and enable more goods to move more easily around our country. This will be £1.4bn invested in local communities to build the transport system we need to get the economy back on track.

In total the schemes announced today are worth over £854m with an overall DfT contribution of £586m. They are:

The new road runs to the East and North of Norwich with a new junction onto the A47 at Postwick (£86.5m DfT contribution towards a total cost of £111.1m).

Projects which will now be considered by the Department in the Spring are;

  * **Leeds New Generation Transport**. The Department has not yet been provided with sufficient evidence with which to assess the value for money of this scheme, as some of the data is relatively new and cannot yet be verified. However, the Department recognises that a strong strategic case has been made and so has given the promoters until 31 March 2012 to update their business case. A decision will be made within two months of that.
  * **SERT (South Essex Rapid Transit)**. The Department has not yet been provided with sufficient evidence with which to assess the value for money of this scheme and has given the promoters until 31 March 2012 to update their business case. A decision will be made within two months of that.
  * **Waverley Link Road**. The Waverley Link Road proposed by Rotherham Borough Council is opposed in its current form by Sheffield City Council, whose land is required for the proposed route. The Department recognises that there is a case for additional capacity in this area but the currently proposed scheme does not appear to be deliverable. Rotherham Borough Council are invited to work with Sheffield and other stakeholders and to propose a resolution to the issue by 31 March 2012.
  * **Bexhill - Hastings Link Road** Ministers recognise the critically important role that transport improvements could play in the regeneration of the Bexhill - Hastings area and the economic case underpinning the Bexhill - Hastings Link Road, though they are also aware of concerns regarding the proposed scheme, including its environmental impact. Before Ministers take a final decision on the scheme they want to be sure that it offers the best approach for regenerating the area and also to consider other transport options to achieve this, including local trunk roads such as the A21, A259 and local rail. They also want to consider whether further environmental mitigation measures could be deployed to address the impacts of the proposed Bexhill-Hastings scheme. Over the next three months the Department will work alongside the scheme's promoters and other local and regional partners to gather further evidence on the optimal solution for the area. The Department would intend to make a decision swiftly thereafter.

The Department also today confirmed the individual allocations to local transport authorities of the £50m top-up to the Integrated Transport Block grant announced by the Chancellor in the Autumn Statement. The top-up will be allocated in accordance with the formula for the Integrated Transport Block grant.

### Notes to Editors

  1. The Department for Transport challenged the promoters of 45 schemes to reduce the costs whilst maintaining value for money.
  2. [Details of the schemes announced today and of the 20 schemes given approval in the Growth Review](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/local-authority-major-schemes-development-pools/lams-development-pools-update.pdf)
  3. The confirmed schemes can now progress to seek statutory powers and formal tender prices, if they have not already done so.
  4. North Yorkshire County Council, in their bid for the A684 Bedale Bypass, included an amount for additional risks that no other promoter included. The original request was for £43.7m whilst our revised offer is £35.9m. North Yorkshire must provide a response to the Department by 31st January or funding for the scheme will be withdrawn.
  5. The Integrated Transport Block Top-Up comes with the same grant conditions that the department set out for the 2011/12 allocation, that is, it is capital grant but otherwise un-ring fenced. Full details of individual allocations will be available on the website but in short authorities can expect an additional sixth to their previously announced 2011/12 annual allocation.

Mary Portas published her review of the future of our high streets today, which sets out her vision to breathe economic and community life back into our high streets.

Mike Penning said:

>In May this year the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister asked Mary to do an independent review of the future of the High Street. Mary's review has set out a number of recommendations that she thinks could make a real difference to areas like Kettering.

>The Government welcomes this report and is grateful to Mary for the time and effort she has devoted to the review. The Government will consider the recommendations carefully and respond in detail next spring.

The Review makes ambitious recommendations on what can be done - by government, local authorities and business - to help high streets deliver something new.

The focus is on putting the heart back into the centre of our high streets, re-imagined as exciting social hubs for shopping, learning socialising and having fun.

In May, with town centre vacancy rates doubling in the space of two years, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister asked Mary to look into how we can create more prosperous and diverse high streets.

The Review sets out Mary's recommendations to free up the high street from constraint, to level the playing field, to mobilise landlords and communities, and to address the ongoing management of our town centres.

The recommendations aim to:

  * **Get town centres running like businesses**: by strengthening the management of high streets through new 'Town Teams', developing the Business Improvement District model and encouraging new markets;
  * **Get the basics right to allow businesses to flourish**: by looking at how the business rate system could better support small businesses and independent retailers, encouraging affordable town centre car parking and looking at further opportunities to remove red tape on the high street;
  * **Level the playing field**: by ensuring a strong town centre first approach in planning and encouraging large retailers to show their support for high streets;
  * **Define landlords' roles and responsibilities**: by looking at disincentives for landlords leaving properties vacant and empowering local authorities to step in when landlords are negligent; and
  * **Give communities a greater say**: by greater inclusion of the high street in neighbourhood planning and encouraging innovative community uses of empty high street spaces.

Mary also recommends that her suggestions are tried out in a number of High Street pilots.

Mary Portas said:

>I don't want to live in a Britain that doesn't care about community. And I believe that our high streets are a really important part of pulling people together in a way that a supermarket or shopping mall, however convenient, however entertaining and however slick, just never can.

>Our high streets can be lively, dynamic, exciting and social places that give a sense of belonging and trust to a community. Something which, as the recent riots clearly demonstrated, has been eroded and in some instances eradicated.

>I fundamentally believe that once we invest in and create social capital in the heart of our communities, the economic capital will follow.

>Those who see high streets purely in commercial terms need a reality check, because, without the engagement and collaboration of local people many high streets will die and retailers, landlords and local authorities alike will see their investment wasted.

>This review sets out what I think has led to the decline of our high streets, my vision of the future and the key things I believe we need to put in place to deliver that vision.

>I hope that my recommendations can be a catalyst for change but high streets must be ready to experiment, try new things, take risks and become destinations again.

>Local authorities, landlords, retailers and the public work need to work together to really animate the spaces they occupy; re-imagined as destinations for retail, socialising, culture, health, wellbeing, creativity and learning.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

>The High Street should be at the very heart of every community, bringing people together, providing essential services and creating jobs and investment; so it is vital that we do all that we can to ensure they thrive.

>I am delighted that Mary Portas has produced such a clear vision on how we can create vibrant and diverse town centres and breathe life back into our high streets.

>The Government will now review Mary's recommendations and we will publish our response next spring.

The report is published alongside new government commissioned research, 'Understanding High Street Performance', which shows that: although some high streets continue to thrive, a third are degenerating or failing; by 2014 less than 40% of retail spending will be on the high street; and over the last decade out of town retail floorspace has risen by 30% while in town floorspace has shrunk by 14%.

The Government will respond to the recommendations in the spring.

The Government believes that the funding will deliver better services for passengers in a way that will cut carbon and deliver growth.

A new £50 million Better Bus Areas fund is an initiative which will see bus operators working in partnership with local authorities to increase passenger numbers. Successful bids must have the backing of at least one major local bus operator. Bids could include measures to reduce congestion, provide better information to passengers, make improvements to bus stations or encourage people to switch to buses from the car in densely populated urban areas.

The Government is also announcing today a further £10 million to support the development of Community Transport, which will provide funding to 76 local authorities.

Today's injection of £60 million comes on top of the announcements in the Autumn Statement which provided:

  * £20 million for a third round of the Green Bus Fund, to help bus operators and Local Authorities to buy low carbon buses;
  * £10 million to fit pollution reduction technology to London buses. This is made up of £5 million funding from central Government and £5 million match funding from Transport for London. The new equipment will cut NOx emissions from buses in the Capital by around 400 tonnes - and will also help promote UK jobs in manufacturing and supplying clean vehicle technology.

Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>This package of bus measures will support growth in our economy by creating better links to work, shops and schools, as well as helping to cut carbon emissions. This huge injection of £50 million for our new Better Bus Areas will encourage partnership working between good local authorities and good bus companies, which will benefit bus passengers.

>In terms of the Green Bus Fund announcement, the UK is fast establishing itself as a world leader in low carbon bus technology, and I am proud to deliver this vote of confidence in our bus building industry. This is great news for jobs and manufacturing in this country.

>The £20 million being provided is in addition to the £47 million that has already helped put 540 new low carbon buses on our roads and demonstrates how serious we are about reducing carbon emissions from transport.

Local authorities wishing to bid for money from the Better Bus Areas fund will be asked to submit bids in February to allow the Department to award funding by the end of March.

### Notes to Editors

  1. More [information about the Green Bus Fund](/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101010)
  2. To further support the establishment and development of Community Transport, the Government is making available £10 million to be distributed to 76 local authorities in England, outside London, by formula; this is a repeat of the Supporting Community Transport Fund announced in March 2011.
  3. The Better Bus Area Fund is separate from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund, which provides £560 million over four years for transport projects which will create growth and cut carbon. However, a bid for money from the Better Bus Areas or Community Transport funds may form part of a bid to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund.
  4. NOx is primarily made up of two pollutants, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Stringent EU targets are in place for NO2.

At present, if a council wants to change the classification of one of its roads - for example downgrading an 'A' road to a 'B' road - it has to have this approved by the Department for Transport. 

From April next year local councils will be able to set the classification of all the roads under their control, without the need to secure Whitehall approval. This will help them make clear to drivers which roads are most suitable for through-journeys, potentially reducing congestion on local routes and cutting unnecessary bureaucracy both locally and nationally. 

Norman Baker said: 

>This reform will cut out pointless form filling that has been around since the 1960s and lead to more local decision making. It will mean councils can better control traffic in their area by ensuring 'A' roads are placed where they want traffic to run and lower the category of a road in places they want traffic to avoid.
 
>Having consulted on our plans, we have learnt that councils and residents' associations all agree this is the right way to go forward.

The everyday operation of the system will be entirely in the hands of the local council. Central government will only deal with contentious cases via an appeals system where there are serious disagreements about a council's decision.

To ensure that motorists continue to get a consistent road network when they cross from one county to another, a council will need to consult neighbouring authorities before implementing cross-border changes. 

Local authorities will be required to send a formal record of any changes to its road network to the DfT but the reporting system will be streamlined, with the current eight forms replaced by one. 

As part of the consultation, the Department also took the opportunity to examine whether there might be better ways to link the management of the system with satnav technology.  Further work will be carried out and an update provided in the new year.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The consultation response can be found at: [www.dft.gov.uk/publications](/publications/road-network-policy/). 
  2. At present, the Department for Transport must approve all changes to roads classification (whether a road is an A road, a B road, a minor road or an unclassified road) and all changes to the Primary Route Network (major A roads that are coloured green on most maps).
  3. Under the new approach, local authorities will have responsibility for road classification in their area.
  4. The Department will maintain a list of 'primary destinations', but local authorities will decide by which routes they are best connected, working together where necessary. 
  5. Local authorities would prefer to see the new system introduced at the start of the next financial year. The new system will be fully introduced in April 2012. 
  6. We will provide guidance for authorities later this year to help them in decision making.
  7. The Department will remain responsible for the Strategic Road Network (motorways and major A-roads operated by the Highways Agency) in England.
  8. Roads classification and the Primary Route Network are a devolved matter in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The £500million Growing Places Fund will be available to help boost economic growth by getting the required infrastructure built to enable the creation of new jobs and homes by getting stalled projects moving again.

The Fund will put local businesses and organisations in the driving seat, with the 38 local enterprise partnerships able to apply for the funding and then take decisions about what to prioritise locally.

Councils will support these plans with their technical and financial expertise - leaving local enterprise partnerships free of red tape and better able to focus their attentions on ensuring the funds go to where they will be used most effectively.

And to ensure work can start straight away to help get Britain building again, all £500million will be allocated from the end of January.

The Growing Places Fund can be used to establish revolving funds to take forward a range of projects that can help facilitate economic growth, jobs and housebuilding in the local area, providing returns which can be re-invested locally. Through this, local enterprise partnerships will be able to offer secure funding to developers in their area, making it quicker for projects to get off the ground but also securing a return on that investment for the local area.

Types of projects could include:

  * Early development of strategic link roads and access works to unlock major mixed-use developments, enabling the delivery of homes and commercial space - leading to the creation of jobs and securing private investment;
  * Provision of flood storage capacity to enable development of homes, employment space and retail space; and
  * Works to improve local connectivity and reduce congestion through interventions such as extending dual carriageways, enabling developments to be taken forward sustainably.

And today, Ministers have published indicative allocations of the £500m Growing Places Fund to each of the 38 local enterprise partnerships, including:

  * £12.9million for the Liverpool City Region
  * £23.9million for the Leeds City Region
  * £17.4million for the Local Enterprise Partnership covering Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire
  * £14.9million for Birmingham and Solihull;
  * Nearly £40million for London; and
  * £14.2 million for the Heart of the South West Local Enterprise Partnership

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

>The £500million Growing Places Fund will unlock much-needed local infrastructure and get the homes we need built. It will be local enterprise partnerships, made up of the people and businesses who know their local areas best, who will decide where this cash boost will be spent.

>I now want to see these partnerships coming together and finding innovative ways to unlock local sites and help get Britain building again.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>Transport is key to unlocking growth.

>The Growing Places fund will let communities provide the transport links that get people and businesses from A to B.

>This will be crucial in building the balanced and dynamic economy that is essential for our future prosperity.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said:

>The half a billion pound Growing Places fund will kick start local developments across the country.

>This is a flexible fix-it fund that will make a real difference on the ground, improving the lives of local residents and boosting the local economy. From building strategic link roads to reducing congestion, the investment will set businesses free and create jobs.

Notes:

  1. Allocations do not sum to £450m due to rounding. £50m is to go to the Devolved Administrations;
  2. Formula weighted distribution using district level data (2010), with Population and ""Employed Earnings"" (employment multiplied by earnings) given equal weighting;
  3. Economic Development activity is devolved to the Mayor of London, and specific funding arrangements for transport and local economic development are already in place for this year. The entitlement for the London Local Enterprise Partnership is therefore restricted to money coming from the Reserve (£250m in total, less £50m entitlement for Devolved Administrations);
  4. Where districts are in overlapping Local Enterprise Partnerships, the entitlement as a result of that district is split equally between those Local Enterprise Partnerships;
  5. An allocation has been set aside to allow for any districts yet to join a Local Enterprise Partnership.

* Subject to Ministerial approval of Local Enterprise Partnership proposal.

In conventional streets, behaviour is governed by highway infrastructure such as traffic signs, road markings and other street furniture. In streets with shared space much of this infrastructure is removed so it is important that schemes are well designed and can be easily used. 

Shared space schemes have become increasingly popular with councils wanting to regenerate local high streets.  It is up to councils to decide whether or not to use shared space on their roads, but this guidance will help those who do want to use it to implement well-designed schemes.

Norman Baker said:

>We want councils to design high-quality public spaces which enhance the local environment and improve the lives of local people. In some cases, they will decide that shared space is the best solution.
  
>This new guidance will help councils who want to use shared space to improve their streetscape while making sure they take into account the needs of the whole community.

The Local Transport Note on Shared Space has been developed to assist local authorities who want to put in place well-designed shared space schemes.  The guidance places particular emphasis on engagement with the local community and on inclusive design, where the needs of a diverse range of people - including people with disabilities - are properly considered at all stages of the design development process. 

The Local Transport Note on Shared Space can be found here:

## Notes to Editors:

  * The Department for Transport's new Local Transport Note on shared space addresses a growing need for guidance on the planning, design and provision of shared space schemes.  The guidance is evidence based and is the culmination of a two-year research project.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110909,New Bikeability support contract signifies government commitment   ,New contract to provide day-to-day Bikeability support services announced.,"The Department for Transport is today pleased to announce a new contract to provide day to day Bikeability support services.  This follows a commitment given earlier this year by the DfT to support and provide funding contributions for Bikeability for the remainder of the parliament. 

£11 million has been made available for cycle training during financial year 2011-12. This is helping to deliver up to 275,000 cycle training places to school children aged between 10-11. 

Transport consultancy firm, Steer Davies Gleave, have won a competitive tender process to manage the day to day running of the Bikeability programme.  Previously this work was shared between four different contracts.  Using a single supplier to provide support will save an estimated £1.2m over the next three and a half years.

Transport Minister, Norman Baker, said:

>This government is strongly committed to cycling.  Enabling children to learn to cycle safely and confidently on today's roads plays a valuable role in creating a new generation of cyclists. That is why we took the decision to safeguard the future of Bikeability with the aim of giving as many children as possible the opportunity to take part in Bikeability cycle training.

>Bikeability promotes the benefits of cycling as a healthy and enjoyable way of getting around. On a wider level it helps to reduce congestion, gives children more opportunities for exercise, and plays a part in the fight against climate change.

The rules for local highway authorities and school games organiser host schools (formally School sports partnerships) who receive Bikeability grants are also being changed to allow more flexibility of grant use.  Examples include offering training to a greater age range.  Currently training is aimed at year six school children but the changes mean that children ranging between school years 5-9 (aged 9-14) will now get the opportunity.  Grant recipients will also be able to consider offering the more advanced Level three training.  This covers complex road situations to support children cycling in busier areas.     

Peter Zanzottera, Bikeability Support Manager, said:

>Steer Davies is proud to be associated with Bikeability as we have been since it started in 2007.  With this new contract we offer continuity to all of the stakeholders, parents and children and we anticipate new products and initiatives to swell the numbers of new cyclists.

## Notes to Editors

  * Funds for the support services are worth £2.1 million over 3.5 years subject to contract extensions. Their responsibilities will include providing specialist advice to DfT, making grant payments and looking after all materials associated with the scheme.
  * Four companies were invited to tender, one later withdrew leaving three suppliers who submitted bids to the Department.
  * Bids were assessed in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulation 2006. 
  * Steer Davies Gleave was contracted to run the Bikeability support service from November 2008 to September 2011. Before that the company was contracted to develop the service and to help local authorities and school sports partnerships apply for grant funding from the DfT. The company has also run a parallel contract to administer and develop the National Standard for cycle training which underpins Bikeability.
  * Full details of the changes to the grant rules will be released to grant bidders later this year.

The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funding will allow Northamptonshire County Council to carry out vital improvements and maintenance to their street lighting. 

The PFI scheme will fund the maintenance of the street lights for the next 25 years. In the next 5 years the county council will replace about two-thirds of its lighting stock throughout the county with the remaining third of columns having their lamps and electronics changed. A new centrally controlled management system will also be installed which will pick up any faults remotely, removing the need for inspection patrols.

Norman Baker said:

>Good street lighting is vitally important in cutting road accidents. Updating lights which are long past their best before date will also reduce energy consumption. 

>That is why, despite current financial constraints, we have made over £132million available to Northamptonshire for this important scheme. 

>We will continue to invest in transport infrastructure that improves safety and provides reassurance to local communities.

Today's announcement will allow Northamptonshire to move to the final stages of contractual arrangements. It is expected that work could commence later this year. 

## Notes to editors 

  * The project includes an initial five year core investment period where the main replacement of lighting stock, traffic signs and street bollards will be undertaken by the service provider with an ongoing 25 year maintenance and repair programme. 
  * The Department for Transport is today granting final approval for this project which in value is worth £132.7million over the projects 25 year life.

39 projects have won funding as part of the first allocation from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. They cover eight regions and a total of 37 local authorities, with many more as partners. All have been judged to be effective against the fund's two key objectives of creating growth and cutting carbon.

The successful schemes also include a variety of measures such as smart ticketing, the promotion of infrastructure for electric vehicles, bus and rail improvement measures, cycling and walking and are designed to link together to create a sustainable transport package that delivers economic growth. 

Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>I am delighted to be able to fund these excellent projects.

>All the winning schemes have one thing in common - they will help build strong local economies while addressing the urgent challenge of climate change.

>We have empowered local authorities to create packages of sustainable initiatives that are tailored for their local areas, and this is only the beginning - even more funding will be announced next summer following a second round of bids.

Successful bids include:

  * South Yorkshire, where there are plans to introduce a 'wheels to work' scheme to help those in the most isolated areas get to work by bike, scooter or electric scooter, as well as new cycle infrastructure and a 'Jobconnector' bus service to provide access to a new employment site.
  * Oxford, where the council plans to support economic growth and development in the town centre by expanding the park and ride scheme, while introducing a single integrated smart card for car parking, buses and cycle hire.
  * Lowestoft, where a new swing bridge for pedestrians and cyclists will enable residents and visitors to travel more easily within the town, targeting a congestion pinch point to bring additional footfall to local shops.
  * Stratford upon Avon, where plans include a new rail station and supporting train services; park and ride bus service enhancement and a walking and cycling facility to link the station with key residential and employment areas.
  * Hampshire, where there are plans for a package of measures including car sharing, electric vehicle charging posts and improvement to bus services, by providing better information and ticketing using a smart phone application. 
  * Plymouth, whose bid to introduce ITSO smart ticketing will support economic growth, reduce carbon and enhance social mobility throughout the South West of England. 

An independent panel with expertise in delivering sustainable transport has been appointed to advise Ministers on the bids including representatives from the British Chamber of Commerce, the Campaign for Better Transport and the local authority  
body ADEPT.

The expert panel said: 

>We were delighted to see that many local authorities had submitted high quality bids which will deliver economic growth in a low carbon way. We welcome the Department's decision to involve people from outside Government, with a wide range of expertise, in the assessment of the bids. We look forward to seeing the words in the bids transformed into actions on the ground.

Richard Hebditch, Campaigns Director at Campaign for Better Transport, said:

>We're really pleased that these areas will receive funding from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. We've long called for funding for these kinds of programmes, which we know from the pilot Sustainable Transport Towns can cut congestion and cut carbon. We're looking forward to seeing the practical results which I'm sure will make a big difference to these areas.

The benefits of the investment will also be felt on a national level. Apart from the obvious benefits of supporting economic growth, enabling and encouraging people to make more sustainable travel choices will reduce traffic delays, which cost the economy around £11 billion a year in urban areas. Better and more sustainable public transport will help tackle problems such as air quality and noise, whilst improved cycling and walking infrastructure will help to combat the health problems associated with physical inactivity.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110404b,"New EU rules for lorry, bus and coach operators ","Consultation on new EU rules for lorry, bus and coach operators.","A consultation on the implementation of new EU rules covering the licensing of lorry, bus and coach operators was announced today by Roads Minister Mike Penning.

The European rules under which hire and reward operators are licensed are being changed by a new EC Regulation coming into force in December 2011. This includes a requirement for all member states to establish a national register of operators as already exists in the UK. It will also require other member states to act on information from UK enforcement agencies when operators commit infringements.

Mike Penning said:

>The operator licensing system exists to make sure that the buses, lorries and coaches using our roads are operated safely and legally. 

>These new EU measures will help to level the playing field for UK operators by making sure that there are effective mechanisms in all member states to allow enforcement agencies to report illegal activity by foreign vehicles. 

>Our proposals for the implementation of these new EU rules will help to strengthen the operator licensing system and improve road safety without imposing unnecessary burdens on industry.

The areas covered in the consultation include the role of transport managers, how operators can demonstrate sufficient financial standing and how operators' transport managers can demonstrate their professional competence.

The [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-11) starts today and seeks views on how the new rules can best be implemented by the Traffic Commissioners, who issue operator licences and take enforcement action against those who break those rules. It will close on 20th May 2011.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The current EC rules on operator licensing are contained in EC Directive 96/26/EC as amended by Council Directive 98/76/EC and 2004/66/EC. These will be replaced by EC Regulation 1071/2009 which will apply from 4 December 2011. These new rules affect fare-paying passenger vehicles and the haulage industry.
  * The key areas where the consultation exercise seeks views are:  
### The role of transport managers
The transport manager is given more prominence in the new rules and in some cases, there are restrictions on how many operators and vehicles they can be responsible for. Under the new arrangements transport managers will be able to receive an EC-wide ban if they break the rules.   
### Financial standing  
Operators must continue to demonstrate that they have enough finance to run their business properly, there are new rules on how it can be demonstrated.  
### Professional competence  
There are new rules on how operators' transport managers can demonstrate their professional competence or claim 'grandfather rights' and on how the certificate of professional competence is awarded from December 2011.  
### Establishment  
There are new rules on how operators must prove that they are properly established and there are proposals to increase the fines available for operating without a valid operator licence and not declaring offences.  
###National registers  
The Regulation establishes a national register of operators in each member state. 
  * The consultation will run from 4th April 2011 to 20th May 2011

Central and local government have worked in partnership to save £209 million within the Spending Review period. This will now allow an extension to the Nottingham tram, together with highways maintenance improvements in Sheffield, Hounslow and the Isle of Wight, to continue to the next stage of the funding approval process.

Norman Baker said:

>This Government is committed to delivering an effective, sustainable and high quality transport network across the country despite the tough economic conditions. 
 
>By vigorously pursuing cost reductions we can invest in a greater number of key local infrastructure projects which help boost the economy and jobs, thanks to the benefits these projects provide in their local areas.
 
>Following the spending review last year, we challenged the four local authorities to look again at the cost of the PFI projects they are promoting to ensure we get maximum value for every pound we spend.

>The Department has been working closely with the authorities involved to ensure these projects are affordable. I am pleased that they have been able to rise to the challenge and have identified savings of 21 per cent from the original estimated costs. 
 
>By finding these savings, I can confirm that we are today allowing these projects to move a step forward within our funding approval process.

The projects can now continue their procurement processes and, subject to approval of a final business case, be able to award the service contracts.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The Department for Transport [press notice ](http://nds.coi.gov.uk/clientmicrosite/Content/Detail.aspx?ClientId=202&NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=416118&SubjectId=36) issued on 26 October 2010, following the Spending Review, set out the Government's intention to proceed with a number of local authority PFI projects in procurement, subject to ensuring affordability and value for money.
  * Today's announcement allows the following projects to move forward to the next stage in the funding approval process: Nottingham Express Transit Phase 2; Isle of Wight Highways Maintenance; Sheffield Highways Maintenance; and London Borough of Hounslow Maintenance. Here are the details:

### Nottingham Express Transit Phase 2 

This scheme is being procured as a Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Maintain (DBFO) PFI scheme. The first line of Nottingham Express Transit (NET) opened in March 2004 running from the main rail station through the city centre to Hucknall to the north of the city. This project would involve two new extensions:

  * The 9.6 km Chilwell and Beeston route would run from the railway station to the south west of the city, serving the ng2 development site, the region's main hospital at the Queens Medical Centre, the University of Nottingham, Beeston town centre and Chilwell before terminating at a new park and ride site serving the A52 and close to junction 25 of the M1.
  * The 7.3 km long Clifton route would run from the railway station to the south of the City. It would serve residential areas such as the Meadows and the Clifton Estate before terminating at a new park and ride site serving the A453 (to capture commuters from the M1 south).

### Isle of Wight Highways Maintenance

This scheme will allow Isle of Wight Council to improve the island's infrastructure including roads, footways, street lighting and other aspects that are related to the highway. It includes almost 499 miles of road with 477 miles of footway. The project also includes 12,000 street lights, a number of bridges and other structures.

### Sheffield Highways Maintenance

The project proposed by the Council is a comprehensive highway maintenance project designed to achieve a co-ordinated approach to the highway and street scene. The project which the Council has called ""Streets Ahead"" will encompass the entire highway network in Sheffield, including 1,200 miles of carriageways and 2,000 miles of footways and or bridges and streetlights.

### London Borough of Hounslow Maintenance

With 458 miles of pavements and 259 miles of roads, Hounslow has a duty to maintain its streets in a safe condition. This project would revitalise the Borough's roads, pavements, bridges and other street furniture.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110204,Over £45m savings give boost to transport improvements ,Nine local  transport schemes get the go-ahead today after £45.5 million of savings found.,"Nine local transport schemes were given the go-ahead today after £45.5 million (14 per cent) of savings were identified, Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 announced.

The savings mean additional schemes across the country can now be brought forward for consideration.

A further 23 schemes have today been given the green light to bid for funding from a pot worth around £630 million. These schemes have provisionally identified overall savings of 42 per cent.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>The Government is committed to delivering transport projects which improve journeys while also helping economic growth.
 
>Following the spending review we challenged local authorities to look again at the cost of proposed schemes to ensure we get maximum value for every pound we spend. The councils being awarded funding today have met that challenge by achieving a saving to the taxpayer of £45.5 million on the original proposed costs.
 
>That means more money is now available for other schemes across the country and I would urge other councils to follow this lead as they bid for funding. This will allow us to fund as many schemes as possible, delivering improvements to roads and public transport across the country.

The Department for Transport announced in October that it was seeking best and final offers from local authorities for 10 schemes which it was prepared in principle to support. Following this challenge the local authorities found overall cost savings of 14 per cent. The schemes are worth over £365 million with an overall DfT contribution of £275 million. They are:

  * Leeds Station Southern Access: Improving pedestrian access to Leeds station (£12.4 million DfT contribution towards a total cost of £14.4 million)
  * Midland Metro Extension: Extending Midland Metro tram line through Birmingham City Centre (£75.4 million DfT contribution towards a total cost of £129.2 million)
  * Mansfield Public Transport Interchange: A new bus station and associated transport improvements in Mansfield (£7.2 million DfT contribution towards a total cost of £8.9 million)
  * Thornton to Switch Island Link: A new single carriageway road which will take traffic away from communities in Sefton (£14.5 million DfT contribution towards a total cost of £18.6 million)
  * Ipswich Fit for the 21st Century: An integrated package of sustainable transport improvements in Ipswich (£18.3 million DfT contribution towards a total cost of £21.5 million)
  * East of Exeter: Improvements to M5 J29, east of Exeter, providing access to new housing and employment areas (£10.4 million DfT contribution towards a total cost of £14.4 million)
  * Heysham to M6 Link Road: A bypass to the north of Lancaster, connecting Heysham to the M6 (£110.9 million DfT contribution towards a total cost of £123.3 million)
  * A57 M1 to Todwick Crossroads: Improvements on the A57 east of M1 J31, near Todwick (£11.8 million DfT contribution towards a total cost of £14.7 million)
  * Taunton Northern Inner Distributor Road: A new road in Taunton to provide additional cross town capacity and access to areas of brownfield land (£15.2 million DfT contribution towards a total cost of £21.7 million)

The Department announced in October that all other local transport schemes for which it had received funding bids had been assigned to one of two 'pools'. 

Schemes in the development pool were told that they would be invited to bid for funding later in 2011. Schemes in the 'pre-qualification pool' have been subject to further assessment to determine which of them can enter the development pool.

This work has now been completed and the Department today announced that 23 schemes will move into the development pool after the local authorities indicated an overall 42% saving can be found. Nine schemes from the pre-qualification group and two schemes which have been withdrawn by the promoter have not been moved to the development pool and are no longer being considered for funding in this spending review period.

The Department hopes to fund the majority of the schemes now in the development pool subject to their business cases being of an acceptable standard. However, the total likely funding request to DfT is nearly £950m, so the process remains competitive and local authorities will need to look for further savings to stand a good chance of funding.

Decisions on these schemes will be made by the end of 2011.

The schemes which have moved to the development pool are:

  * A43 Corby Link Road
  * Luton Town Centre Transport Scheme
  * Darlaston Strategic Development Area Access Scheme (Walsall)
  * Camborne-Pool-Redruth Transport Package
  * A164 Humber Bridge to Beverley Improvement
  * Northern Road Bridge (Portsmouth)
  * Kingskerswell By-pass (South Devon Link Road)
  * South Bristol Link Phases 1&2
  * Worcester Integrated Transport Strategy
  * A452 Chester Road Access Improvements
  * Lincoln Eastern Bypass
  * South Yorkshire Bus Rapid Transit (Northern Route)
  * Morpeth Northern Bypass
  * Tipner Interchange (Portsmouth)
  * Coventry-Nuneaton Rail Upgrade 
  * South Essex Rapid Transit
  * Bus Rapid Transit North Fringe to Hengrove (Bristol)
  * Croxley Rail Link (Hertfordshire)
  * Elmbridge Transport (Gloucestershire)
  * A4184 Evesham (Abbey) Bridge Maintenance (Worcestershire)
  * A45 Westbound Bridge Maintenance (Solihull)
  * London Road Bridge Maintenance (Derby)
  * Leeds Inner Ring Road Maintenance

The nine pre-qualification pool schemes which will not be funded in this spending review period are:

  * A509 Isham Bypass (Northamptonshire)
  * Watford Junction Interchange
  * Castleford Town Centre Integrated Transport Scheme
  * A24 Ashington to Southwater Improvement (West Sussex)
  * A61 Penistone Road Smart Route (Sheffield)
  * Stafford Western Access Improvements
  * Tyne & Wear Bus Corridor Improvement - Phase 1
  * A338 Bournemouth Spur Road Maintenance
  * A38(M) Tame Viaduct Maintenance (Birmingham)

The two schemes withdrawn by the promoter are;

  * Northern Gateway (North Tyneside)
  * Sunderland Central Route

##  Notes to editors 

  1. The [Written Ministerial Statement](http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/hammond-20110204) to Parliament by the Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31
  2. The confirmed schemes can now progress to seek statutory powers and formal tender prices, if they have not already done so. For the schemes in Exeter and Mansfield the necessary statutory approvals and tender prices are already in place so funding will be released to enable the schemes to start construction in 2011/12.
  3. The remaining scheme in the Supported Pool, the Mersey Gateway Bridge, has a complex financial case. The department is therefore continuing to carefully consider the funding proposal from Halton Borough Council. Final funding arrangements will be confirmed as soon as possible.
  4. The following schemes remain in the development pool. They are still eligible to bid for a pot of around £630m. The department will conduct some further analysis and invite best and final funding bids from the promoters by September 2011: 
    * Waverley Link Road (Rotherham)
    * Beverley Integrated Transport Plan
    * A684 Bedale-Aiskew-Leeming Bar Bypass (N Yorks)
    * Norwich Northern Distributor Road
    * Bus Rapid Transit Ashton Vale to Temple Meads (Bristol)
    * Loughborough Town Centre Transport Scheme
    * Leeds Rail Growth package
    * Nottingham Ring Road
    * Access York Park & Ride
    * Weston-Super-Mare package
    * Bath Transportation Package
    * A6182 White Rose Way Improvement Scheme (Doncaster)
    * Rochdale Interchange
    * Crewe Green Link Southern Section
    * Sunderland Strategic Corridor
    * A18-A180 Link
    * Manchester Cross City Bus
    * Pennine Reach (East Lancs Rapid Transit)
    * Sheffield Supertram additional vehicles
    * Hucknall Town Centre Improvement Scheme (Nottinghamshire)
    * Leeds New Generation Transport
    * Bexhill to Hastings Link Road
    * Final decisions will be made by the end of 2011.
  5. Of the schemes with Conditional Approval in October we undertook to make decisions as soon as possible on a case-by-case basis. The Reading Station highway works scheme was re-confirmed with Conditional Approval on 16 December 2010 with a DfT contribution of £9.6 million, reduced from £15 million. Walton Bridge was granted Full Approval on 29 December 2010 with a DfT contribution of £23.875 million, reduced from £29.844 million. The other scheme in this category, the Isles of Scilly Ferry Link, is still under consideration but we hope to make a decision on the way forward very soon.
  6. The department cannot at this point consider any new local authority schemes other than those already allocated to a group.
  7. An update to 'Investment in Local Major Transport Schemes'has now been published which sets out the details of the scheme approval decisions and explains the rationale on which they have been based. We will also shortly publish the Best and Final Funding Bids and Expressions of Interest that have been submitted by the Local Authority promoters.

It is the first step in a two part process to reform the Humber Bridge Board. The board will now have one member from each of the Humber area local authorities.

A private Bill to make two private sector representatives nominated by the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership full voting members of board will be introduced later this year.

The Government wrote down the Humber Bridge debt by £150 million on 31 March and the bridge toll for cars was reduced from £3 to £1.50 on 1 April.

Since its introduction in 2000, Merchant Navy Day has provided an opportunity to remember the sacrifices of the seafarers of the past, to show appreciation for British shipping today and to look ahead to our future as a maritime nation.

Shipping Minister Mike Penning said:

>Merchant Navy Day is an opportunity to not only remember seafarers of the past, but to look to a bright future for UK shipping. More than 20,000 merchant seafarers lost their lives in the Second World War alone, while working to provide this country with the means to survive. We owe those brave seafarers a debt of gratitude for their sacrifices and the contribution they made to our national wellbeing.
 
>More recently, it has been encouraging to see a real revival in UK shipping and in the number of young people seeking a career at sea. The British maritime sector, while facing the challenge of competition from abroad, still has a great reputation. The vast majority of goods arriving or departing the UK do so by sea, so we look forward to a future where the UK continues to be a significant and successful maritime nation.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The Red Ensign is the official flag of the commercial shipping fleet of the UK and its Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories. It will fly over the headquarters of the Department for Transport - Great Minster House in Horseferry Road, London SW1 - on Monday 3 September. The significance of the date is that it is the anniversary of the sinking of the SS Athenia, the first British merchant vessel lost during World War II.
  2. Since January 2002 the UK registered trading fleet has increased from 5.03 to 16.64 million gross tons, an increase of over 230% over the past decade. The UK has the thirteenth largest Merchant Fleet in the world and the fifth largest in Europe.
  3. The increase in tonnage on the UK shipping register has been achieved without compromising quality standards. The Maritime & Coastguard Agency (MCA) have appointed dedicated Customer Account Managers to assist with enquiries throughout the registration process. This - and removing excess regulation - has made the UK flag more attractive.
  4. The tonnage tax was introduced in the Finance Act 2000. Shipping companies can opt into tonnage tax, or stay in the current corporate tax regime. Tonnage tax applies normal corporation tax to notional profits determined by the tonnage of the ships operated. It brings certainty and clarity about tax liabilities and is used by a number of other EEA countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Greece and Norway. The tonnage tax is enabling British shipping to be more internationally competitive.
  5. A feature of the UK tonnage tax is the minimum training obligation. This normally requires each shipping company in the tax to recruit and train one officer trainee each year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet, and to give consideration to employment and training opportunities for ratings.
  6. The Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme has been running since April 1998 and provides financial support for courses approved by the Merchant Navy Training Board (MNTB) and the MCA for the training of officers and ratings.

All twenty four delegations that spoke after the proposal had been presented expressed their appreciation and supported it without exception.

Building upon an earlier proposal from CLIA, the United Kingdom led a coalition of government and industry stakeholders in support of the proposal.

UK Shipping Minister, Mike Penning said:

>Taking a cruise should be a safe and enjoyable experience. However we have been reminded in recent years that crime exists at sea as it does on land, and we should be certain that there are effective mechanisms in place to respond to this. I am grateful to those at the IMO, our partners CLIA and the Philippines for their help in making such valuable progress. I would now urge all other flag states to get behind this important proposal.

CLIA President and CEO, Christine Duffy, said:

>CLIA greatly appreciates the extensive leadership and commitment of Minister Penning, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines in advancing this important proposal to governments.

Key elements of the proposal included: preservation of evidence; medical and pastoral care for victims; effective and timely reporting to governments; and cooperation between governments with regard to investigations.

The technical work necessary to complete the guidelines will begin immediately and will be led by the United Kingdom who will work with other Member States of the IMO to ensure that the development of guidelines are proportionate for different ships types and without excessive burden to the Master and crew, a crucial element will be consultation and input from CLIA and other organizations with specialized expertise and consultative status within the IMO.

## Notes to Editors

1. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is the United Nations specialised agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships.

2. Cruise Lines International Association(CLIA) is the world's largest cruise association and is dedicated to the promotion and growth of the cruise industry. CLIA is composed of 26 of the major cruise lines serving North America and serves as a non-governmental consultative organization to the International Maritime Organization. CLIA's mission is to promote policies and practices that foster a safe, secure and healthy cruise ship environment; educate and train its travel agent members; and promote and explain the value, desirability and affordability of the cruise vacation experience.

3. The UK Government and CLIA remain fully committed to the issue of crimes at sea and will now, led by the UK, engage with IMO Member States and other organizations with specialized expertise and consultative status within the IMO to develop guidelines that are proportionate and suitable for all ship types and size and which do not impose excessive burden on the Master and crew.",4/20/2012,sustaining-a-thriving-maritime-sector,,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111206a,Change in UK policy on employing armed guards to protect against Somali piracy,UK-registered vessels will be able to employ armed guards to defend themselves against pirates in exceptional circumstances,"UK-registered vessels will be able to employ armed guards to defend themselves against pirates in exceptional circumstances under new guidance confirmed by the Government today.

The move comes after a significant increase in the number of attacks against vessels in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden in recent years.  Evidence shows that vessels with armed guards are less likely to be successfully attacked, which is why the Government has been working in recent months to allow the lawful use of armed guards in exceptional circumstances.

The guidance published today includes the factors ship owners should include in a risk assessment and advice on selecting a private security company (PSC).  Shipping companies wishing to use armed guards will also be required to submit a detailed counter-piracy plan to the Department for Transport in advance.

Shipping Minister Mike Penning said:

>The word 'pirate' can conjure up cartoonish images of eye patches, parrots and wooden legs, but the reality is much more serious.  Modern pirates are dangerous, organised criminals who have shown they are not shy of using violence to achieve their goals.  We have not taken this decision lightly. It is clear that we must offer those flying the Red Ensign every opportunity to ensure the safety of their crews and vessels.

>By allowing the use of armed guards in a structured, legal framework we can move to a system where ship owners can provide an adequate deterrent against this scourge on the maritime industry.

Under the changes published today, any PSC employed to put armed guards onboard UK ships will require authorisation from the Home Office for the possession of prohibited firearms.  The Home Office and police will also carry out checks into the PSC and its personnel before an authorisation is granted.

The guidance published today will be kept under review to ensure it reflects continuing work being done at both a national and international level to counter the increase in piracy around the world.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The guidance to the UK shipping industry on the use of armed guards on vessels is available on the [Department for Transport website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/use-of-armed-guards-to-defend-against-piracy):
  2. The exact circumstances under which the use of armed guards could be permitted are:
  3. when the ship is transiting the high seas throughout the High Risk Area (an area bounded by Suez and the Straights of Hormuz to the North, 10°S and 78°E); AND
  4. the latest ""Best Management Practices"" is being followed fully but, on its own, is not deemed by the shipping company and the ship's master as sufficient to protect against acts of piracy; AND
  5. the use of armed guards is assessed to reduce the risk to the lives and well being of those onboard the ship.
  6. In the last four years, 64 people have lost their lives as a consequence of Somali piracy.  Currently 12 vessels and over 240 hostages are in the control of pirates off the Somali coast.

The proposals, which were announced for consultation in July, will make the Coastguard better coordinated, more resilient to the challenges of the future and will increase the number of regular coastguard officers working in coastal communities, who provide leadership and support to the volunteers of the Coastguard Rescue Service.

The plans - which will modernise how rescues are coordinated and do not affect the services which go out to perform rescues - will create a nationally networked system of Coastguard coordination centres comprising:

  * one Maritime Operations Centre, to be established in Fareham, Hants, with a back-up facility at the existing Dover coordination centre, both operating on a 24 hour basis; and
  * eight Coastguard Centres, all operated on a 24 hour basis, located at Falmouth, Milford Haven, Holyhead, Belfast, Stornoway, Shetland, Aberdeen and Humber. The station at London is also retained.

Mike Penning said:

>After many years of uncertainty, these reforms provide a clear plan for the future of Her Majesty's Coastguard. They will deliver a resilient and fully networked national rescue coordination service. They will make much better use of the talents and skills of our Coastguards and will provide more interesting and rewarding work with better pay.

>The UK coastguard has a great heritage. This is a blueprint for a 21st century Coastguard that commands even greater respect and it will provide an organisation of which coastguards themselves and all of us can be justly proud.

Under the plans the Coastguard co-ordination centres at Forth, Clyde, Great Yarmouth, Liverpool, Thames, Swansea, Brixham and Portland will close progressively by 31 March 2015. The centre at Solent will be replaced by the new Maritime Operations Centre.

While a rescue coordination function will no longer be required in these locations, new coastal operational hubs - providing better leadership, support and training for the volunteers of the Coastguard Rescue Service - will be established at the existing sites at Liverpool, Swansea and Thames, as well as in the Clyde area, and through the further development of the MCA's site at the former HMS Daedalus at Lee-on-Solent.

The new Maritime Operations Centre will be housed in a purpose built emergency services centre at the vacant Fire Control Centre building at Fareham. The building's existing facilities mean that the Maritime Operations Centre can be established quickly.

How Coastguard rescues are co-ordinated has changed little over the past forty years. Currently, operations are coordinated from 19 dispersed centres with no network of national integration. This means that there is very limited resilience in the event of high demand or technical problems and it is impossible to spread the workload evenly across the system, leaving staff in one centre struggling to cope with call volumes while workloads in another may be low. The plans confirmed today will create a resilient and nationally networked system of Coastguard coordination centres as well as giving Coastguards more opportunity to develop and apply their skills, offering increased responsibility, a recognised career path and the remuneration to reflect this.

### Notes to editors

  1. The blueprint for the future of HM Coastguard is available on the [Maritime and Coastguard Agency website](http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue.htm)
  2. The Government first launched a consultation on Coastguard modernisation in December 2010. The Government then published updated proposals for consultation in July 2011. The first set of proposals had proposed establishing two Maritime Operations Centres (in the Southampton/Portsmouth area & Aberdeen) and five sub-centres, operating in daylight hours only, as well as retaining the 24 hour centre at Dover which oversees English Channel activity.
  3. There were a total of over 1,800 responses to the consultation launched in December 2011. These reflected a general acceptance that change and modernisation is necessary, but also expressed concerns over a potential loss of local knowledge and a perceived weakening of operational relationships. The second consultation, on the revised proposals launched in July 2011, has attracted 800 responses.
  4. Compared to the consultation launched in December 2010 the plans confirmed today keep more centres open, all operating for 24 hours, and retain more coastguard jobs. At least one coastguard centre in each of the existing operational 'pairs' - where work and local intelligence is already regularly shared - will be retained.
  5. That second consultation exercise invited views on four specific issues: the case for a single Maritime Operations Centre; keeping both the centres at Stornoway and on Shetland; whether there were factors to support the retention of Liverpool rather than its paired centre at Holyhead; and whether there were factors to support the retention of Swansea rather than its paired centre at Milford Haven.",11/22/2011,sustaining-a-thriving-maritime-sector,,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111110c,Public to have their say on maritime red tape,Shipping Minister Mike Penning began work that could see Maritime red tape slashed as part of the RED Tape Challenge,"Life could be about to get easier for shipping companies, port authorities, ferry operators and those who simply use our seas for pleasure after Shipping Minister Mike Penning began work that could see Maritime red tape slashed.

Over two hundred [shipping, maritime and ports regulations have been placed on the Red Tape Challenge website](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/maritime/) - a Government-wide site aimed at reducing bureaucracy - for four weeks. The public and wider maritime industry are being asked whether they think that a regulation is well designed and provides vital protections, or is badly designed, badly implemented or simply a bad idea.

Regulations under the spotlight will include those instances where the UK has gone beyond the minimum required by EU or international legislation. The exercise also presents an opportunity to see if some of the UK's more historic maritime legislation is still fit for purpose and suited to today's maritime needs.

Areas for deregulatory consideration include:

  * Removing unnecessary aviation-related legislation that historically has applied to hovercraft
  * Removing the requirement whereby the master of certain British ships serving a strategic function has to be a Commonwealth or EEA national or nationals of NATO countries
  * Assess the requirement for certain ships to weigh road vehicles and cargo, a practice that does not apply to vessels in foreign ports returning to the UK
  * Removing antiquated reporting requirements

Shipping Minister Mike Penning said:

>This is a chance for everyone to have their say, whether they own a dozen oil tankers, a little motor boat or are just armchair mariners. We are determined to eliminate badly thought out and obsolete regulations.

>There is no getting away from the fact that good quality regulation can add real value to the competitiveness of the maritime industry while balancing genuine environmental, safety and security concerns. However, by reducing red tape we can help free businesses to be more competitive, create jobs and just make things less complicated for people.

Business and Enterprise Minister Mark Prisk said:

>Since the Red Tape Challenge was launched in April, we have received more than 25,000 comments and proposals made by the public and businesses. Already this has resulted in plans for significant changes to legislation - we have looked at 378 pieces of regulation and announced plans to remove or simplify 220 of these.

>I'm delighted that more than two hundred shipping, maritime and ports regulations have been placed on the Red Tape Challenge website. Reducing regulation for Britain's maritime industry can only help exports and growth.

The Government has recruited experienced 'sector champions' who will be providing expert knowledge during the Red Tape Challenge based on the issues they faced in their fields. The sector champions are:

  * Mark Brownrigg, Director-General, The Chamber of Shipping
  * David Whitehead, Director, British Ports Association
  * Gus Lewis, Legal and Government Affairs Manager, Royal Yachting Association

Mark Brownrigg, Director-General at Chamber of Shipping said:

>Shipping is a highly regulated industry - world-wide, in Europe and nationally. We therefore need regulation in order to carry out our business and to demonstrate that the UK is among the world leaders. The Red Tape Challenge provides a great opportunity to weed out out-dated regulations and the unwarranted bureaucracy that they entail, and to review our existing regulations to make them clear and fit for purpose.

Gus Lewis, Legal and Government Affairs Manager at the Royal Yachting Association said:

>The RYA believes that any legislation or regulation should be transparent, accountable, proportionate and consistent and only targeted at cases where sound risk and evidence analysis demonstrates that such action is needed. This process gives us a unique opportunity to challenge those regulations that do not satisfy these criteria.

David Whitehead, Director of British Ports Association said:

>Ports legislation comes at us from all directions. Planning, licensing, the environment, navigational safety and security are just some of the sources of the rules and regulations which apply to us. The Red Tape Challenge is a terrific opportunity to look at how we might prune, consolidate, simplify, and even convert into codes of practice this array of maritime legislation.

The overall aim of the Red Tape Challenge is to remove barriers to economic growth and increase individual freedoms. The presumption is that regulations will go, unless their retention can be justified.

Instigated in 2000, Merchant Navy Day provides an opportunity to honour those merchant seafarers who have in many cases given their lives to the industry, as well as the chance to celebrate success and look ahead to the future of British shipping.

Shipping Minister, Mike Penning, said:

>This country has a rich and proud maritime heritage covering many centuries and I am confident this will continue long into the future.

>It is often forgotten that over 20,000 merchant seafarers lost their lives in the Second World War alone, doing a job that was crucial to the war effort. On Merchant Navy Day we remember them, and the other men and women of the Merchant Navy who have lost their lives over the years.

>Shipping is every bit as important to the UK today - with the vast majority of goods arriving in our country by sea.  The twenty-first century has so far been marked by a revival in the fortunes of British shipping, which I am determined to see continue. 

>More young people are being attracted to a career at sea, and more ships are flying the Red Ensign. Our shipping register has a reputation for high standards, which we have every intention of maintaining. So we salute British ships and seafarers, and look with optimism to the future prosperity of the UK maritime sector.

## Notes to Editors

  * The Red Ensign is the official flag of the commercial shipping fleet of the UK and its Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories.  It will fly over the headquarters of the Department for Transport - Great Minster House in Marsham Street, London SW1 - on Saturday 3 September. The significance of the date is that it is the anniversary of the sinking of the SS Athenia, the first British merchant vessel lost during World War II.
  * Since July 2001 the UK registered fleet has increased from 6,700,130 to 18,074,997 gross tons, an increase of over 160% over the past decade.  The UK has the eleventh largest Merchant Fleet in the world and the fourth largest in Europe.
  * The increase in tonnage on the UK shipping register has been achieved without compromising quality standards. The Maritime & Coastguard Agency (MCA) have appointed dedicated Customer Account Managers to assist with enquiries throughout the registration process. This - and removing excess regulation - has made the UK flag more attractive.
  *  The tonnage tax was introduced in the Finance Act 2000. Shipping companies can opt into tonnage tax, or stay in the current corporate tax regime. Tonnage tax applies normal corporation tax to notional profits determined by the tonnage of the ships operated. It brings certainty and clarity about tax liabilities and is used by a number of other EEA countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Greece and Norway. The tonnage tax is enabling British shipping to be more internationally competitive.
  * A feature of the UK tonnage tax is the minimum training obligation. This normally requires each shipping company in the tax to recruit and train one officer trainee each year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet, and to give consideration to employment and training opportunities for ratings.

In January 2010, the Board published proposals which would enable it to privatise the Port of Dover, bringing in outside investment to help increase capacity.  These plans were subject to an eight-week public consultation.

In a written statement to Parliament this morning, Mr Penning asked the Board to publish further work they have since carried out on the likely impact of the scheme, including details on proposals for a Port of Dover Community Trust and Share Employee Ownership Trust.   He also requested a further period of consultation with interested parties, which will begin in the next few days.

Mike Penning said:

>Dover is a vital piece of our national infrastructure and it is important that local residents, port users and other organisations have a say in its future.  I have therefore asked the Board to publish some more information on their plans, as well as providing the opportunity for additional consultation.  This will give all individuals with an interest in the Port of Dover a further and better-informed opportunity to comment on the Board's proposals.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The period for further representations is expected to begin in the next few days and will close on 27 August 2010.
  * The Port of Dover is a trust port, which means it has no owners or shareholders and any surpluses are reinvested in the port. 
  * In January, Dover Harbour Board submitted a transfer scheme to the Department and published it with [proposed revised articles of association and a briefing document](http://www.doverport.co.uk/?page=corporaterestructuring)
  * Under the Ports Act 1991, if a scheme is approved by the Secretary of State, the trust port concerned may transfer its assets and liabilities into an operating company, which can then be sold.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110714b,Government announces updated coastguard reforms,Coastguard stations will be better coordinated and more resilient to the challenges of the coming decades under updated modernisation proposals.,"Coastguard stations will be better coordinated and more resilient to the challenges of the coming decades under updated modernisation proposals announced today by Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31.

The Coastguard has been helping to manage our seas and protect those who use them for over two centuries. However, the service has undergone few changes over the past forty years and is now in need of modernisation as the current structure is not sufficiently resilient and fluctuating workloads cannot be properly distributed. The Government launched a consultation in December 2010 on modernisation proposals designed to address these issues and provide enhanced career opportunities for Coastguard officers. 

There were a total of over 1,800 responses to the consultation and while these reflected a general acceptance that change and modernisation is necessary, they also expressed concerns over a potential loss of local knowledge and a perceived weakening of operational relationships. The Government's updated proposals reflect these responses and propose creating a nationally networked system of Coastguard stations comprising:

  * one Maritime Operations Centre in the Southampton/Portsmouth area with a back-up facility at the existing Dover site which will be retained as a 24 hour centre; and 
  * eight sub-centres, all operated on a 24 hour basis, located at Falmouth, Milford Haven, Holyhead, Belfast, Stornoway, Shetland, Aberdeen and Humber. The small station at London is also retained. 

Previously the Government had proposed establishing two Maritime Operations Centres (in the Southampton/Portsmouth area & Aberdeen) and five sub-centres, operating in daylight hours only, as well as retaining the 24 hour centre at Dover which oversees English Channel activity.

Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

> We have been clear that modernisation is required to deliver a resilent Coastguard service, fit for the 21st century. But we have always been open to debate about how that should be achieved. This has been a genuine consultation that has seen a high level of engagement and many well-thought out responses - including specific alternative proposals. It is clear from the responses that there is huge public and political admiration for the work of our Coastguard, a clear consensus that change and modernisation is necessary, but also some specific concerns about the original proposals.

>Our updated proposals will ensure the safety of seafarers and coastal communities, delivering the modernised and more cost-effective service we need for the 21st century, while also responding to the concerns raised during the consultation process.

Under existing arrangements, neighbouring stations are 'paired', allowing them to provide back-up to one another when needed. Today's announcement means that one station in each pair is retained.

Under today's proposals the Coastguard stations at Clyde, Forth, Portland, Liverpool, Yarmouth, Brixham, Thames and Swansea would close progressively over the period 2012 to 2014/15.  The station at Solent will be replaced by a new Maritime Operations Centre in the Portsmouth/Southampton area. 

There will now be the opportunity for people to comment on those elements of today's announcement which differ from the original proposals. These will be the subject of a further period of consultation, which will run for twelve weeks ending on 6 October 2011. 

## Notes to Editors

1. Detail of today decisions

In detail, the Government has concluded:

  * That it is right to continue with proposals for a nationally networked system with the introduction of one Maritime Operations Centre (MOC) capable of managing incidents anywhere and ensuring optimum distribution of workload across the system.
  * That establishing one MOC, rather than the two previously proposed, allows us to address concerns over local knowledge and the robustness of the future concept of operations by retaining one of each of the current 'paired' stations with the retained centres operating as part of the nationally networked system 24 hours a day rather than during daytime only - staff in each of the current 'pair' of stations are already familiar with, and frequently exercise, taking calls and managing incidents in an adjacent area.
  * That the Northern Ireland Coastguard centre at Bangor should be retained because of the specific requirement to manage the civil contingency arrangements unique to Northern Ireland and the relationship with search and rescue partners in the Irish Republic with whom we coordinate closely in air sea rescues in the waters around Ireland.
  * That, in light of the decision to retain one station from each pair, and concerns about Welsh language communication, the Holyhead station, rather than the one at Liverpool should be retained.
  * That, in response to concerns expressed over the resilience of infrastructure and communication links within the Scottish Islands and with the Scottish mainland, Coastguard centres in both Stornoway and Shetland should be retained.
  * That, in the light of a further review of the potential costs of vacating the existing sites in Swansea and Milford Haven which has shown that there are no financial reasons to favour either location, and in view of the Department's substantial levels of employment in Swansea, the coastguard centre at Milford Haven rather than the centre at Swansea should be retained.

2. A review of all the responses to the consultation launched in December 2010 has been produced under the leadership of a Non-Executive Director of the MCA, involving a number of serving coastguard officers and members of the PCS union. This has been placed in the Library of the House of Commons and can be found on the Maritime and Coastguard website.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110707,Government consults on Liverpool cruise plans,The City of Liverpool Cruise Terminal could be permitted to change the way it operates under proposals put forward for consultation by Shipping Minister.,"The City of Liverpool Cruise Terminal could be permitted to change the way it operates under proposals put forward for consultation by Shipping Minister Mike Penning today - potentially paving the way for passengers to start and end their voyages in the city.

Opened in 2007, the terminal was built with the help of grants from the North West Development Agency and the European Regional Development Fund. As there was deemed to be potential for unfair competition with other UK ports, operations at the terminal were restricted to cruises calling at the city as part of a longer trip and currently do not allow for cruises to start and end in the city. Last month Liverpool City Council put forward proposals for a partial repayment of this public subsidy in return for a lifting of these restrictions. The Government is now consulting on a potential way forward based on these proposals.

Shipping Minister Mike Penning said:

>Liverpool has a rich maritime heritage spanning many centuries, and I am keen to see that continue. However, I have been clear throughout this process that I am equally committed to ensuring fair competition across all UK ports. That is why I am pleased that Liverpool City Council have come forward with proposals which recognise this. 

>However it is also important to hear the views of other interested parties, which is why I am launching a 10-week consultation. Once this period is over, I will consider carefully any comments I have received before making a final decision.

The proposals put forward by Liverpool City Council include a repayment of £5.3m spread evenly over 15 years. A targeted consultation of port operators and other interested parties will now take place until 15th September. A final decision on whether to approve Liverpool City Council's application is expected early in the new Parliamentary year.

## Notes to editors

1. The City of Liverpool Cruise Terminal (""CLCT"") is owned by Liverpool City Council (""LCC"") and operated on its behalf by Peel Ports.

2. At present, CLCT is subject to a grant condition which precludes its use for ""turnaround"" operations: that is, the beginning and/or end of cruise voyages. It is thus limited to use for port of call cruises only.

3. This condition was set at the request of the Department for Transport in order to safeguard fair competition with other terminals that had not benefited from public subsidy, either at all, or at least in recent years. Previous requests to remove this condition (or more strictly, for DfT to remove its objection to so doing), without any offer of grant repayment, have been declined.

4. Grants awarded to the CLCT (which opened in 2007) were approximately as follows:  
 
| CLCT | £M |
| North West Development Agency | 7.16 |
| Single Regeneration Budget | 1.88 |
| European Regional Development Fund | 8.62 |
| Mersey Waterfront Regional Park | 0.16 |
  
The proposed repayment is approximately £5.327 million, spread evenly over 15 years. 

5. In proposing a staged repayment, Liverpool City Council requested that liability for repayments should cease in the event that turnaround use is terminated at some date within the 15-year period. The Government is not minded to agree to this condition, because it feels this amounts to an element of risk-sharing that does not exist for non-subsidised ports. 

6. The repayment will be to the Exchequer. Under the proposal, Liverpool City Council would not be required to repay ERDF funding to the Commission. However, the Council would have to accept the risk of the Commission demanding any additional repayment of grant on State Aids grounds.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110118,UK and Irish Ministers agree reform for funding of Irish Lights ,Reform agreed for funding of Irish Lights.,"UK Shipping Minister, Mike Penning, and Irish Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, have reached an agreement that will see aids to navigation off the coast of the Republic of Ireland wholly funded from domestic sources there by 2015-16.

Under existing arrangements, the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) effectively receives a subsidy for its activities in the Republic of Ireland from levies paid by ships calling at UK ports. Now the two Ministers have agreed to phase this out, with a view to CIL's Republic of Ireland operations being funded entirely from domestic sources there by 2015-16.

The Ministers also confirmed their support for the existing structure of three General Lighthouse Authorities, comprising the Northern Lighthouse Board (in Scotland and the Isle of Man), Trinity House (in England and Wales) and the Commissioners of Irish Lights (for the whole island of Ireland). A further agreement was reached to share all relevant information on light dues charging to assist the CIL in their transition to self-sufficiency. CIL will also continue to receive Ministerial support as it works with the other GLAs to deliver continued and additional efficiencies in the future.

Mike Penning said:

>The safety of all who sail round our coasts is paramount and aids to navigation play a crucial role in keeping our waters safe. I am grateful to my Irish counterpart for his understanding of the concerns of those who pay light dues in the UK, and this agreement will enable us to continue our support for the UK shipping industry, while ensuring the future of the all-Ireland Commissioners of Irish Lights.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The Commissioners of Irish Lights is the general lighthouse authority which provides marine aids to navigation for the benefit of mariners visiting and passing the shores of the whole island of Ireland.
  * For many years, the funding of the Commissioners of Irish Lights work has been a joint undertaking, its costs being met primarily from light dues income from commercial shipping raised in both our jurisdictions and paid into the General Lighthouse Fund.
  * Light dues are charged at 41 pence per net registered ton (NRT) with a cap of 40,000 tons.

The trial is being launched on Sunday to encourage more older and disabled people to use trains, and means concessionary bus pass holders will be able to claim discounted fares on two test routes without purchasing an annual Senior Railcard, which costs £28.

The scheme is being rolled out by First Great Western and will apply to standard off-peak fares between Worcester and Swindon via Stroud, and between Westbury and Weymouth. The Department will be assessing the trial keenly to see if a wider and more permanent application might be merited.

Rail Minister Norman Baker said:

>This is great news for bus pass holders and hopefully they will take full advantage of the discounts on offer through this innovative scheme.

>Everybody is feeling the squeeze at the moment and this trial will help older and disabled people save money while travelling on these two important railway lines.

>The railways are not only a crucial part of our country's economic growth but they also provide a valuable link for families and friends. I am confident this scheme will help bolster those links and provide real benefits to those who need it most.

Campaigning groups including the National Pensioner's Convention and the National Federation of Occupational Pensioners have previously lobbied for concessionary bus passes to be used as a senior railcard, and believe it will lead to higher numbers of older and disabled people purchasing rail tickets.

The Department will work with First Great Western to examine the commercial viability of the scheme with a final report due in November next year.

Mark Hopwood, First Great Western Managing Director, said:

>First Great Western is privileged to provide services to some of the country's leading destinations and our branch lines to Worcester and Weymouth are symbolic of that.

>We are delighted to be able to take part in this trial, which should help improve access for senior citizens and people with disabilities to the services that we offer.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The aim of the Study is to provide the DfT with robust information to inform Train Operating Companies (TOCs) and the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) on the commercial viability of extending some of the privileges associated with the Senior and Disabled Railcard to all holders of English National Concessionary travel passes.
  2. FGW will carry out a discount scheme over the course of one year offering holders of concessionary travel passes a 34% discount on standard class tickets at off-peak times (after 9.30am and before 11pm on weekday, all day on weekends and bank holidays) on the test areas of the rail network.
  3. The study will report quarterly on a quantitative assessment of the changes in peak and off-peak patronage amongst older and disabled customers that result from the discount scheme being available. Comparisons, where appropriate will be made to First Great Western's continual customer research study; Customer Satisfaction Monitor (CSM).
  4. DfT is due a final research report from FGW in November 2013.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120822a,Helping train operators improve services for cyclists,A new Cycle-Rail Toolkit aimed at making it easier for people to combine cycling with rail travel has been launched by Transport Minister Norman Baker.,"A new [Cycle-Rail Toolkit](http://cycle-rail.co.uk/hq-cy/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ATOC-Toolkit-low-res-single.pdf) to aid train operators and make it easier for people to combine cycling with rail travel is being launched today by Transport Minister Norman Baker.

The Minister asked the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) to develop guidance on cycle and rail integration for train operating companies and this toolkit is the result of their work. The toolkit will help train operators improve provision for cyclists by setting out how to provide good facilities, encourage new cycle-rail users and promote and market these facilities to ensure that as many people as possible benefit.

The guidance has been developed in consultation with TOCs, the DfT, the wider rail industry and cycling campaign bodies and draws good practice from both national and international examples. It is aimed at TOC managers and local authorities and will be a useful tool for those looking to improve access to rail services or considering bidding for new rail franchises.

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>This new toolkit provides some useful guidance and examples to help train operating companies get things right for cyclists. It highlights what will be effective in encouraging more people to make their door-to-door journey using a combination of rail and cycling.

>Cycling is good for the environment, good for your health and can save you money. By getting rail passengers to leave their cars at home and take the bike instead, traffic congestion can be cut and carbon emissions slashed - it's a win-win.

>I hope train operators and local authorities take advantage of this useful information.

Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of ATOC, said:

>Cyclists are an important part of the railway's future and train companies are absolutely committed to improving facilities so that ever more people can leave their bikes at stations and travel by rail.

>The toolkit shows how train companies have improved conditions for cyclists and highlights the industry's commitment to even better facilities, which will help those already in the saddle, and encourage yet more people to ride their bikes to and from their local train stations.

The guidance is available from ATOC and will be one of main focuses of the ATOC Interchange and Integrated Transport Conference, at which the Minister is the Keynote speaker in Manchester on September 27th, for more details [interchangeandintegration.co.uk](http://www.interchangeandintegration.co.uk)

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120815a,New operator for West Coast rail passengers,Rail passengers will benefit from improvements including more trains and more seats.,"Rail passengers from London to Scotland will benefit from a package of improvements including more trains and more seats, as Rail Minister Theresa Villiers unveiled First West Coast Limited as the new operator for the 'InterCity West Coast' franchise.

As part of the deal First West Coast Limited will introduce 11 new six-car electric trains which will enable more seats to be provided across the franchise, including greater capacity on the Birmingham to Scotland route. New services are planned from Blackpool, Telford, Shrewsbury and Bolton to London. First West Coast Limited has also committed to cut the cost of its 'Standard Anytime' fares by an average of 15% within the first two years.

The franchise stretches from London to Glasgow, connecting many of the UK's major cities including Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Edinburgh, Lancaster and Chester. The franchise deal is worth £5.5 billion (net present value) over the lifetime of the contract.

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>This new franchise will deliver big improvements for passengers, with more seats and plans for more services. Targets to meet on passenger satisfaction will be introduced for the first time in an InterCity rail franchise and passengers will also benefit from smart ticketing and from investment in stations.

>The West Coast is the first of the new longer franchises to be let by the Coalition which has helped us secure real benefits for passengers by encouraging First West Coast Limited to invest in the future of the service.

Benefits the new franchise will offer passengers include:

  * **More Seats**: The new 11 six-car electric trains will deliver circa 12,000 extra seats a day, from December 2016 with the cascade of existing rolling stock to bolster capacity on West Coast routes. This is in addition to the 106 extra 'Pendolino' carriages which are currently being introduced into operation on to the franchise, which will deliver over 28,000 extra daily seats.
  * **More Services**: Initially First West Coast Limited will operate the timetable they will inherit from the current franchise but are seeking to introduce a number of new services including a London Euston to Blackpool service from 2013 and from 2016 services from London to Telford Central, Shrewsbury and Bolton.
  * **Improved Services**: Journey time improvements between London and Glasgow are planned, as well as additional services from London to Preston.
  * **Fares**: First West Coast Limited is changing its Standard Anytime fares and reducing them by an average of 15% over the first two years of the franchise.
  * **Improved Stations**: First West Coast Limited is taking over responsibility for maintenance at 17 of their stations and will spend at least £22m on a station investment programme.
  * Smart ticketing technology: First West Coast Limited will introduce ITSO based smart ticketing. This will offer speed and convenience as well as new ticket types more tailored to individual needs.

## Notes to editors

  1. Bids were received from; 
    * Abellio InterCity West Coast Limited - NV Nederlandse Spoorwegen),
    * First West Coast Limited - FirstGroup plc,
    * Keolis / SNCF West Coast Limited - Keolis SA and SNCF,
    * Virgin Trains Limited - Virgin Group Holdings Limited.
  2. Virgin Trains has operated the franchise since 1997 and the existing contract expires on 9 December 2012. The new franchise will begin operation on Sunday 9 December 2012. The franchise will operate for a core term of 13 years and 4 months, with an option to be extended to operate for up to 15 years.
  3. The proposed Train Service Specification for new Inter City West Coast represents a relaxation from the rigid timetable specification of the past, while retaining obligations that protect the key elements of service, such as principal first and last trains and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day. This marks a significant shift from the highly detailed specification which featured in previous franchise specifications.
  4. To support its bid, First West Coast Limited has provided £10m of Shareholder Capital, a £45m Performance bond agreement and a subordinated loan of £190m. This is in addition to the requirement to provide a Season Ticket bond of circa £5m and a £15m Parent Company Guarantee to ensure the new Station Facilities maintenance obligations are met.
  5. This longer franchise length encouraged investment in assets such as stations by extending the period over which commercially attractive schemes can pay back.
  6. Anytime fares allow the use of any train, including at weekday peak times. Anytime tickets are not the only ones available to walk-on passengers. Off-peak fares are also available on the day and - as their name implies - are generally valid on all but peak services.
  7. The new services are subject to obtaining the necessary permissions and access rights from the Office of Rail Regulation.
  8. ITSO is a government-backed common technical standard for smart travel which means that transport operators throughout Britain can link up so passengers only have to use one secure payment 'smart' card no matter what bus, train or route they are using.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120727a,New Great Western franchise to deliver new express trains,"The new 15 year Great Western franchise will see passengers benefit from new express trains, additional capacity and more.","The new 15 year Great Western franchise will see passengers benefit from new express trains, additional capacity, smart card ticketing and passenger satisfaction targets as part of proposals being put forward today by Rail Minister Theresa Villiers.

The number of train services required by the new franchise will be based broadly on the current timetable, rather than the contracted minimum in the existing franchise. The popular Sleeper Service to Penzance will be retained. An extra early, fast train from London to Plymouth will be introduced. This will achieve aspirations for a 'there and back in a day' service to Plymouth from the capital.

Successful extra local services such as those on the Truro to Falmouth, Par to Newquay and the Severn Beach Lines, including those which are locally funded at present, are being added to the base specification of the franchise. This recognises the valuable work and track record of investment made by local stakeholders. Full responsibility for funding these local schemes is expected to pass to the Department for Transport from 2015, securing their future and freeing up local resources for other transport priorities.

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>Passengers using the Great Western Line will benefit from major infrastructure improvements and new rolling stock over the next few years, as a result of the Government's ambitious programme of rail improvements, including extensive electrification.

>For the first time on the Great Western franchise, we will be introducing requirements on passenger satisfaction for the train operator to meet which will mean they have to focus strongly on the issues that matter the most to passengers. Extending smart card ticketing across the franchise will provide many more passengers across the West and South West with the kind of convenience Oyster has brought to Londoners. The Sleeper train is being retained, Plymouth gets the new early train from London they asked for and the future of popular extra local services such as the Severn Beach Line and Truro to Falmouth has been secured.

>This new franchise will see additional capacity delivered to benefit passengers. A more efficient and flexible franchise will encourage private sector investment, for example in improving stations and investing in rolling stock. It will promote greater efficiency and also enable the train operator to react to more effectively to changing passenger demands.

The new franchise will run for 15 years from July 2013 to July 2028. It will require broadly the same number of trains to run between end-to-end destinations as is the case today, while giving the new operator greater flexibility with regard to timetabling and calling patterns and, in certain instances, use of connecting trains.

This flexibility will help ensure the line is used in the most efficient way for passengers and potentially allow faster journey times and improved services. It will also encourage private sector investment in the franchise, including stations.

A final decision has not yet been taken on the exact number of through services between Paddington and Penzance. The Invitation to Tender requires the continuation of 9 journey opportunities between London and Penzance each day (in addition to the Sleeper) with at least 6 being provided by through trains. After discussions with local MPs and Cornwall Council, the Government is asking the bidders to explore with stakeholders how rail services in Cornwall might be improved to ensure the right balance between long distance and regional services is achieved. The ITT therefore requires bidders to provide a price for additional through journeys above the minimum and also for a half hourly regional service on the Cornish main line. Decisions on whether these options are affordable and can go ahead will be taken prior to the new franchise being agreed.

A number of other options which could help to further improve local services have been included which potential operators are invited to consider and provide pricing for so that they can be taken forward if a value for money solution is provided and local funding is available.

## Notes to Editors

  * 1. Details published of the new franchise that will begin from 21 July 2013, are set out by the [Department in the Invitation to Tender (ITT)](/publications/great-western-franchise-2013/).
  * 2. The Invitation to Tender follows a consultation designed to give the public and stakeholders a chance to have their say on what they wanted from the new franchise.
  * 3. The proposed Train Service Requirement for the operation of the Great Western franchise represents a change from the rigid timetable specification of the past, while retaining obligations that protect the key outcomes for passengers and taxpayers, such as principal first and last trains and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day. This marks a significant shift from the micro-management that has prevented operators from maximising capacity and optimising timetables to react to the changing demands of their passengers in the past.
  * 4. The four shortlisted bidders from run the franchise from July 2013 are: 
    * First Great Western Trains Limited (FirstGroup plc);
    * GW Trains Limited (Arriva UK Trains Limited - DB (UK) Investments Limited);
    * NXGW Trains Limited (National Express Group PLC); and
    * Stagecoach Great Western Trains Limited (Stagecoach Group plc).
  * 5. Bids for the franchise are expected to be received in October 2012 and the new operator will be announced in March 2013. The new Great Western franchise will run until July 2028, with an option for the Department to extend for up to 7 reporting periods.
  * 6. When the Government set out its plans on franchise reform, it acknowledged that each franchise contract needs to reflect the different characteristics of the lines and services it covers. Therefore the requirements set out in the Great Western Franchise may not necessarily become standard terms in every subsequent rail franchise.
  * 7. The ITT for the Great Western Franchise follows the current agreed regulated fares policy as set out in the 2011 Comprehensive Spending Review - a rise in 2012 of RPI+1% and RPI+3% for 2013 and 2014, returning to RPI+1% thereafter. Over the long term we are committed to reducing the cost of running the railways and the goal of ending the era of above-inflation fare increases.
  * 8. Local services which are expected to move from local to national funding in 2015 include:

Service Description Funding Body

Bristol TM to Severn Beach (frequency increase)
Bristol City Council

Bristol TM to Severn Beach (Sundays)
South Gloucestershire Council

Truro - Falmouth (all week frequency increase)
Cornwall Council

Exeter - Barnstaple (additional M-F and additional Sundays)
Devon County Council

  * 9. Priced Options: The ITT asks bidders to price the following improvements to services:

**1) Services to Cornwall**
Continued operation of 9 through services. Provision of a half hourly, regular service between Plymouth and Penzance or Exeter, from May 2017 when cascaded rolling stock is anticipated to become available.

**2) TransWilts Rail (Phase 1)**

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120725a,£4.5 billion investment in new trains creates new jobs,596 railway carriages will be built at a brand new train factory in the north east of England.,"More than 900 jobs will be created and thousands more secured after Transport Secretary Justine Greening approved a £4.5bn contract to supply Britain with the next generation of intercity trains.

In a major boost to the UK's manufacturing industry, 596 railway carriages will be built at a brand new train factory in the north east of England.

Agility Trains, a consortium made up of Hitachi and John Laing, has been awarded the contract to build and maintain the trains under the Intercity Express Programme (IEP), the project to replace Britain's Intercity 125 trains with new higher capacity modern trains.

Hitachi will assemble an intercity fleet of 92 complete trains at a new purpose-built factory in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, in the process creating 730 skilled jobs with a further 200 jobs during construction of the factory itself and securing thousands more in the UK supply chain. The company will also locate its European rail research and development capabilities on the site which will further enhance the factory's ability to win rail contracts across Europe.

As well as building the new state-of-the-art assembly facility, Hitachi will construct maintenance depots in Bristol, Swansea, west London and Doncaster, and will upgrade existing maintenance depots throughout Britain.

The announcement comes on the eve of the Global Investment Conference in London where the Government will kick off the largest series of trade and investment events ever held in the UK involving more than 3,000 business leaders, policy-makers and ministers from around the world, and half the companies in the FTSE 100.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>A new train factory is fantastic news for Britain and will be welcomed by everyone who wants to see a thriving UK manufacturing sector. It means 730 new skilled jobs created at the factory, 200 jobs in constructing the plant and thousands of jobs secured in the supply chain.

>The decision to build almost 600 new intercity train carriages is great for rail passengers who will experience faster and more comfortable journeys when travelling across Britain on the East Coast and Great Western main lines.

>Hitachi is the latest major international company to invest on this scale in Britain and I look forward to this new factory in County Durham following in the footsteps of Nissan's successful car plant in Sunderland. There can also be fewer stronger signs that the UK is the best place in which to invest, and from which to develop new markets, than Hitachi's decision to base its European manufacturing base right here in Britain.

The IEP train fleet will be comprised of electric and bi-mode trains, some five vehicles long and others nine vehicles. These will be faster accelerating than existing stock, and will offer the potential for more frequent services. The higher train capacity will mean more seats and less crowding between Britain's major cities. The modern vehicles will offer a step-change in passenger comfort through increased carry-on luggage space, electronic seat reservations, and no compromise on leg-room. A performance regime will encourage the trains to run reliably throughout the life of the fleet.

The IEP builds on last week's rail investment announcement of further electrification on the Great Western Main Line between London Paddington and Swansea, and together the new trains and infrastructure will offer the potential for journey time savings of 15 minutes in Swansea to London journeys and 21 minutes in Bristol to London journeys as part of the forthcoming Great Western franchise. Passengers travelling along the East Coast Main Line will also see improvements to their travelling experience, as journeys between London and Newcastle will potentially be reduced by 13 minutes in the forthcoming East Coast franchise.

Construction at the Newton Aycliffe site is expected to begin in 2013 and will be fully operational by 2015. The first IEP trains will enter revenue-earning service on the Great Western Main Line in 2017 and on the East Coast Main Line by 2018.

Tomorrow's Global Investment Conference at the British Business Embassy in Lancaster House, London, will be followed by 17 Global Business Summits to be held throughout the duration of the Games and will be targeted at individual sectors and countries.

## Notes to editors

  1. IEP is the programme to replace Britain's fleet of Intercity 125 High Speed Trains (HSTs) that were originally deployed by British Rail in the 1970s and 1980s.
  2. This announcement signifies financial close for the Great Western elements of IEP, and commercial close for the East Coast elements. The East Coast elements will be financed during 2013.
  3. The eventual service pattern will be the responsibility of the future franchisees, although the first phase of the new trains could operate on the following routes: 
    1. Great Western: London - Cardiff - Swansea, London - Oxford - Worcester - Hereford, London - Gloucester - Cheltenham, London - Bath - Bristol
    2. East Coast: London - Leeds, London - York - Newcastle - Edinburgh - Aberdeen / Inverness
* There are also options for ordering further trains, which could operate on the following routes: 

  1. Great Western: London - Exeter - Penzance
  2. East Coast: Replacement of the newer Intercity 225 electric stock
  3. East Coast: London - Cambridge - Kings Lynn
  4. West Coast: London - Milton Keynes - Northampton
* The contract structure passes the responsibility for constructing depots and maintaining trains to Agility Trains. The Train Operating Company will pay Agility Trains ""Set Availability Payments"" for each train that reports for duty each day and remains reliable during the operational period. The Department is providing a ""Usage Guarantee"" to Agility that a Train Operating Company will be in place to make use of the new trains.
* This is the first time in recent history that a bi-mode train has been earmarked for the UK rail network. Bi-mode trains are common on some mainland European national rail systems. Both the electric and bi-mode versions of these trains will include regenerative braking, a system whereby electricity is re-cycled back through the overhead wires when the driver applies the brakes.
* Introducing the bi-mode option for the Intercity Express Programme is estimated to save around £200 million (net present value) as compared to introducing a fleet of all-electric trains to be coupled to a diesel locomotive beyond the electrified sections of the railway.
* The 125 mph (200kph) trains will reduce overcrowding as they will be longer; the new carriages will be 26m in length as opposed to the 23m in Intercity vehicles currently in UK use. 26m vehicles are standard in mainland Europe. The faster journey times will also allow operators to run more frequent services.

Under the Coalition Government's Access for All scheme, £1 million will be used to provide a new lift to the footbridge, ensuring level access across the station. The money would also fund new handrails and landings on the existing footbridge.

Rail Minister Norman Baker said:

>We want everyone to be able to access public transport and that is why the Government has provided £1 million to make these vital changes which will benefit passengers using this busy station.

>We are determined to promote equality and fairness for all which is why this week, we have identified a further £100 million for the Access for All programme as a whole, to enable important accessibility work to be carried out at railway stations across the country.

Network Rail route managing director Jo Kaye, said:

>We have a major scheme underway to completely transform the station over the next two years, making it almost unrecognisable to its regular users.

>This cash injection will go a long way towards making the station and its facilities even more accessible than they already are.

The work at Manchester Victoria is expected to start on site in January 2013 and will take around 16 months to complete. The work will help turn the station into a better transport interchange, which will benefit from increased patronage from the Metrolink extensions currently being constructed.

## Notes to editors

  1. Manchester Victoria is one of 154 stations in Britain to receive funding to provide better access to stations through the government's £370m Access for All programme. Launched in 2006 it will deliver an accessible, step free route at key stations. Rail passengers will benefit from better access through the provision of new lifts, ramps, raised ""easier access humps"" on platforms as well as new accessible toilets.
  2. As part of the recent High Level Output Specification (HLOS) announcement, £200m was included to improve stations across the network of which £100m is to be spent on 'Access for All' to provide easier access for older or disabled passengers or those with small children.

The full £9.4bn programme of improvements to the rail network published today will meet the needs of intercity passengers, commuters and freight up to the end of this decade while the Government continues to work on High Speed 2 to deliver rail capacity for the British economy in the decades to come.

This [""High Level Output Specification"" programme](/publications/hlos-2012/) for 2014-2019 will be discussed at today's meeting of the Cabinet which the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister will hold outside London.

Crossrail, Thameslink, and electrification between London and Cardiff, Manchester to Liverpool and Preston, and across the Pennines, are among £5.2bn of projects already committed to during 2014-2019. New schemes totalling £4.2bn unveiled today include:

>Upgrades to stations and tracks creating enough capacity around cities for an additional 140,000 daily rail commutes at peak times. In addition to Crossrail and Thameslink, announced previously, today's enhancements - such as the £350m lengthening of platforms at London Waterloo station - will provide capacity for 120,000 more daily commutes in and out of London and 20,100 extra daily commutes across Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and other cities.

>Faster journeys and more train capacity from £240m of improvements along the East Coast Main Line from the North East down through Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire to London.

>The creation of a high-capacity ""electric spine"" running from Yorkshire and the West Midlands to South Coast ports allowing more reliable electric trains to cut journey times and boost capacity for passengers and freight. This comprises: an £800m electrification and upgrade from Sheffield - through Nottingham, Derby and Leicester - to Bedford, completing the full electrification of the Midland Main Line out of London St Pancras; and electrification of the lines from Nuneaton and Bedford to Oxford, Reading, Basingstoke and Southampton.

>The landmark decision to take electric rail beyond Cardiff to Swansea, completing the full electrification of the Great Western Main Line out of London Paddington at a total cost of more than £600m, and electrifying the Welsh Valley lines, including Ebbw Vale, Maesteg and the Vale of Glamorgan. These will give two-thirds of the Welsh population access to new fleets of electric trains helping to generate Welsh jobs and growth by slashing journey times and boosting passenger and freight capacity.

>Completion in full of the ""Northern Hub"" cluster of rail enhancements with the approval of £322m of outstanding track and capacity upgrades across Manchester city centre, Manchester Airport and across to Liverpool. These are in addition to £477m of Northern Hub schemes already approved across the North of England such as electrification of the North Trans Pennine route between York and Manchester.

>A new £500m rail link between the Great Western Main Line and Heathrow allowing direct services to the airport for passengers from the West Country, the Thames Valley and Wales.

The HLOS package will be funded in part from fare rises already announced in 2010 and also from the substantial efficiency savings which projects like electrification will have on the long term operating costs of the railways.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said: ""Investment on this scale, in every region of the country, shows how this coalition government is focused on delivering an affordable, reliable and faster railway network that drives jobs and growth.

>These plans to increase capacity and shorten journey times on intercity, commuter and freight services are, alongside our plans for high speed rail, absolutely key to securing our country's prosperity in the decades ahead.

The investment was also hailed by the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Prime Minister David Cameron said:

>From Crossrail, high speed rail and now the billions of pounds of investment we are announcing today, this government is committed to taking the long term decisions to deliver growth and jobs.

>In what is the biggest modernisation of our railways since the Victorian era this investment will mean faster journeys, more seats, better access to stations, greater freight links and a truly world class rail network.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said:

>This is the biggest expansion in railways in over 150 years, with more than £9bn of investment across the country.

> Whilst we inherited a deficit greater than any in our nation's peacetime history, we knew that we had to give the country the boost it needs, to build great railways and make journeys better for the millions of hard working people who use the train every day.

>The 'Electric Spine' will make a significant difference for passengers linking London, the Midlands and Yorkshire in a much more efficient rail line, connecting the South and North more effectively than ever before.

>As someone who cares deeply about the environment, the opportunity to dramatically expand rail, a greener form of transport than aviation or road is very exciting indeed. This investment will help people to choose trains over cars, reduce carbon emissions and provide a rail system that is faster, more reliable and greener.

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said:

>I am pleased that the Northern Hub will be funded in full as part of the Government's plans, which is a significant boost for the major towns and cities of the North, helping to rebalance the UK economy and enabling growth and regeneration throughout the regions.

>This Government is making more funds available to invest in rail projects than at any time since the Victorian era, and shows that the Government is committed to delivering on its promises to support investment in public infrastructure that will support economic growth.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120710a,Giving train passengers more information on punctuality,Passengers will be able to find out if train services run on time to within one minute under plans to make more detailed punctuality information available.,"Passengers will from today be able to find out if train services run on time to within one minute under plans to make more detailed punctuality information available for the first time, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced this morning.

Already published Public Performance Measure data currently shows how many trains arrive within five or ten minutes of their scheduled time. Now new statistics published by the [Office of Rail Regulation (ORR)](http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/) today show the percentage of trains arriving early and within one minute of being on time.

Norman Baker said:

>I want passengers to be given clear and simple information on the punctuality of their train services.

>The Coalition Government wants rail travel to be more transparent and that's why we have worked closely together with the rail industry to ensure these statistics will be published.

>This is good news for passengers, as 69.8% of trains on the network are arriving within 59 seconds of when they are supposed to - and 91.6% are meeting the PPM target. This compares very favourably with elsewhere in Europe and across other modes. I will be urging all train operators to go that extra mile and push these figures up even higher.

Transport Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>We want to put passengers at the heart of how our railways are run. Providing more information on the punctuality of services is part of our wider commitment to increasing transparency across government.

>We know the great importance placed by commuters and other rail passengers on the reliability and resilience of our railway network and today's publication is just one of a number of initiatives to give rail users more information about our railways.

The new information is being published at rail industry sector level from today - for London and South East services, for Long Distance services, and for Regional and Scottish services. Further, more detailed data will be available by October.

## Notes to Editors

  1. 'Right time' information is derived from industry train reporting systems and covers trains which arrive early, on time and within one minute of the due time.
  2. The existing Public Performance Measure (PPM), which shows the proportion of train services arriving at their destination within 5 or 10 minutes, for short and long distance services respectively. PPM is and will remain the Government's and industry's key measure of rail punctuality and reliability because: 
    * it recognises the different passenger expectations and operating practicalities between short and long distance services;
    * it incentivises the industry to ensure that the vast majority of services - significantly over 90% - get to their destination at or close to time; and
    * it gives the industry essential flexibility to manage minor operational disruption, which would not be possible with an absolute on time measure.
  3. The Department already publishes [monthly statistics on the reliability of journeys on the Highways Agency's strategic highway network of motorways and trunk roads](/statistics?post_type=release&series=congestion-and-reliability) in England, and detailed information on the performance of each link on that network is available on data.gov.uk. For example, in the year to April 2012, 83.5% of journeys on the strategic highway network were estimated to be 'on time' against reference figures based on historic data for each link on the network.
  4. Similarly, the [Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) publishes punctuality statistics for the UK's ten leading airports](http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=80&pagetype=88&pageid=12&sglid=12). For example, in the year to April 2012, 82% of domestic UK flights to and from Heathrow were early or within 15 minutes of due time, with an average delay of 9 minutes.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120702a,New rail franchise to deliver smart card tickets and encourage investment in better stations ,Invitation to Tender (ITT) on the Essex Thameside franchise.,"The new 15 year Essex Thameside franchise will see passengers benefit from the introduction of smart card ticketing and provide important opportunities for private sector investment in improving stations, under proposals being put forward by Rail Minister Theresa Villiers today.

The Government's [Invitation to Tender (ITT) published today for the new franchise](/publications/essex-thameside-franchise/), will also give bidders much more flexibility to develop their own train timetable to better suit passenger demand.

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>A more flexible franchise will encourage private sector investment, for example in improving stations. It will promote greater efficiency to drive down costs and also enable the train operator to react more flexibly to changing passenger demand.

>The introduction of new requirements on passenger satisfaction will mean the operator has to focus strongly on the issues that matter most to passengers. Across the franchise, the roll out of smart ticketing will provide many more passengers with greater convenience and the sort of advantages already enjoyed in the capital.

The new franchise will run for 15 years from May 2013 to May 2028, with an option for the Department to extend for up to 7 months.

Full repairing responsibilities of the 25 stations, including Fenchurch Street, will be transferred from Network Rail to the new operator.

The franchise agreement will ensure that a minimum number of stops at each station will be provided but gives bidders more flexibility to adapt timetables to cater for changes in demand. This should enable the future franchisee to run services in a more efficient way which is more responsive to the travelling priorities of passengers using the line.

New Service Quality targets have been set and based around stations, train services, train facilities and customer services. The indicators have been weighted to reflect local priorities and will be revised to capture any changes during the franchise.

## Notes to Editors

  1. Details published of the new franchise that will take over from 26 May 2013, are set out by the Department in an [Invitation to Tender (ITT)](/publications/essex-thameside-franchise/)
  2. The Invitation to Tender follows a consultation designed to give the public and stakeholders a chance to have their say on what they wanted from the new franchise.
  3. The proposed Train Service Specification for the operation of Essex Thameside represents a relaxation from the rigid timetable specification of the past, while retaining obligations that protect the key outcomes for passengers and taxpayers, such as principal first and last trains and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day. This marks a significant shift from the micro-management that has prevented operators from maximising capacity and optimising timetables to react to the changing demands of their passengers in the past.
  4. The four shortlisted bidders to run the franchise from May 2013 are Abellio, First Group, National Express and MTR.
  5. Bids for the franchise are expected to be received by 27 September 2012 and the new operator will be announced in January 2013. The new Essex Thameside franchise will run until May 2028, with an option for the Department to extend up to 7 months.
  6. When the Government set out its plans on franchise reform, it acknowledged that each franchise contract needs to reflect the different characteristics of the lines and services it covers. Therefore the requirements set out in the Essex Thameside Franchise may not necessarily become standard terms in every subsequent rail franchise.
  7. The ITT for the Essex Thameside franchise follows the current agreed regulated fares policy as set out in the 2011 Comprehensive Spending Review - a rise in 2012 of RPI+1% and RPI+3% for 2013 and 2014, returning to RPI+1% thereafter. Over the long term we are committed to reducing the cost of running the railways and the goal of ending the era of above-inflation fare increases.

Launching the InterCity East Coast franchise consultation today, Rail Minister Theresa Villiers invited passengers, local councils and anyone with an interest in improved services on the East Coast Main Line to send in their views on what they want from the next franchise.

Theresa Villiers said:

>There are exciting changes on the horizon for the East Coast Main Line. It is set to receive a brand new fleet of InterCity Express trains. The next franchise will be up to 12 years in length giving the operator greater opportunities to invest in improvements that will benefit passengers. 

>The consultation outlines what we expect the next operator to deliver, including better service quality, improvements to stations, the roll out of smart-ticketing technology and good levels of punctuality. Bidders will need to share with us their plans to improve the passenger experience.

>The East Coast Main Line is a key part of our nation's transport infrastructure providing heavily used and economically significant services between north and south. Before we let this franchise, we want to hear from the people who use East Coast and listen to their ideas on better services. This consultation will help us make decisions on how we get the most from the improvements planned for the line over the coming years.

The winning bidder, which will operate services on the East Coast Main Line from 2013, will need to deliver a number of different improvements including in relation to service quality and provision of information to customers, particularly during times of planned engineering works and unplanned disruption. The new franchisee will be responsible for ensuring that overall passenger experience improves throughout the life of the franchise.

The successful bidder is expected to oversee the introduction of new InterCity Express trains on the route, providing more capacity than the High Speed Trains they are planned to replace on much of the franchise. We also want to hear bidders' ideas on how they will improve stations and make them more attractive gateways to rail services.

The substantial car park extension will boost capacity for passengers, increasing the current number of spaces to 959, from its current capacity of 737 spaces.

The Department for Transport will provide £1m, working in conjunction with Chiltern Railways, towards the total cost of the £2.5m project.

Work has already started on the new extension to the car park scheduled to be opened by December 2012.

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>I am delighted that we are able to announce the investment for this considerable car park extension at Warwick Parkway. There is no doubt that this will encourage more people to travel by train.

>Adding additional car park capacity will mean more spaces for passengers, easing congestion and helping improve overall journey satisfaction.

Together with funding from Chiltern, the Government's contribution will improve the passenger experience and bring new commuters to the station.

Chiltern Railways became the first UK operator to own and build a new station when Warwick Parkway opened in October 2000.

Business Development Director for Chiltern Railways, Graham Cross said:

>The launch of our Mainline service between London Marylebone and the West Midlands has resulted in record growth levels and a dramatic increase in passengers travelling from Warwick Parkway. The new multi-storey car park will meet the rising demand and demonstrates our commitment to offering the best service to our customers.

Visiting the Welsh Government's headquarters in Cardiff ahead of the UK Government's forthcoming announcement on rail investment, the Minister met Assembly members to discuss rail services in Wales.

Speaking after her visit, Theresa Villiers said:

>We are overseeing the biggest rail upgrade programme since the Victorian era because we believe a better transport system can play a vital role in spurring economic growth. We want Wales to share in the opportunities that improved rail services can provide.

>Last year, we confirmed plans to electrify the railway line to Cardiff, a move that will bring real passenger benefits including significant time savings between London and south Wales and cleaner and greener train services. New trains will also add to passenger comfort and further speed up journey times.

>We are also supporting the Welsh Government in developing a business case for the Valley lines. Electrification of the Valley lines network was singled out as a priority in the budget, with a decision to be taken this summer.

The new South Eastern franchise is due to start in April 2014 and run until September 2020 with a possible extension by up to two years. The consultation commences on 21 June 2012 and closes on 13 September 2012.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The new South Eastern franchise is planned to commence on 1 April 2014. The new franchisee will need to manage a period of change to facilitate the delivery of the Thameslink Programme, including dealing with the consequences of the rebuilding of London Bridge station. The franchisee will also have a role in assisting with the delivery of Crossrail services.
  2. We are proposing to align the new South Eastern franchise to terminate at the same time as the combined Thameslink Southern and Great Northern franchise (which is also being consulted on). This is because of the inter-relationship between services covered by the two franchises and the degree of change which both networks will experience over the next few years. Although this means a shorter South Eastern franchise than we would normally expect grant, this will help us realise the full benefits of the Thameslink Programme and Crossrail. Scheduling this next South Eastern franchise to end shortly after the completion of these two projects will enable the subsequent franchise to be decided in the context of the major changes they will have delivered to public transport in London and the South East
  3. The consultation exercise will help inform what we include in the Invitation to Tender (ITT) which is scheduled to be released in May 2013. The ITT will: 
    * require bidders to set out how they will successfully deliver the challenges in this franchise and integrate services to improve the overall service offered to passengers; and
    * set out a framework of incentives to allow bidders to develop and enhance services where appropriate but also strike the right balance between commercial freedom for the franchise and ensuring that interests of passengers, taxpayers and the economy are suitably protected.
  4. We expect bidders will develop a suitable vision for this franchise. Developing a meaningful vision means that bidders will need to take into account value for money, affordability and the deliverability of their plans to address future

The franchise is expected to cover most of the existing First Capital Connect franchise, including the Thameslink line which is undergoing a £6 billion upgrade. Services currently run by Southern will be added to the new combined franchise from 2015. This would see a single train operator to take responsibility for all rail services from Brighton to King's Lynn and Southampton to Ashford with London at the heart, creating the largest franchise in the UK rail market.

The consultation launched today gives local communities across the areas covered by the new franchise a chance to say what train services they would like to see run by the winning operator. It also asks the views of potential bidders on how they will improve the experience of passengers.

Theresa Villiers said:

>This new franchise will be a key part of public transport in London and the South of England. Before we set the terms of the franchise and choose who will operate it, we want to hear a wide range of views on the services passengers want.

>We are also seeking views on how to maximise the benefits of the Thameslink upgrade and how they should be shared between different communities along the line.

But we also want passengers, and anyone else with an interest in improving the railways, to tell us about other ways in which they think services could be better.

The combined franchise is due to start in September 2013 and run for a minimum of seven years. The consultation commences on 31 May 2012 and closes on 23 August 2012.

## Notes to Editors

1. The combined Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise (known as 'the combined franchise') would bring together the services currently operated by two franchisees: First Capital Connect (FCC), in 2013 and from July 2015 Southern (including Gatwick Express). However, final decisions have yet to be made on whether all Great Northern services (currently run by FCC) will be included in the new franchise since some may be transferred to the next InterCity East Coast franchise. The combined franchise will also include a number of services now delivered by Southeastern, to be added in 2014 and 2018.

2. The combined franchise would be responsible for delivering rail services across Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Greater London, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Norfolk, Surrey and Sussex. This would make it the biggest franchise that has ever been let. When all the services have been incorporated, it would have the largest income, most trains and most staff of any franchise in the UK rail market.

3. The consultation exercise will help inform what we include in the Invitation to Tender (ITT) which is scheduled to be released in October 2012. The ITT will:

  * require bidders to set out how they will successfully deliver the challenges in this franchise and integrate services to improve the overall service offered to passengers; and
  * set out a framework of incentives to allow bidders to develop and enhance services, where appropriate, but also strikes the right balance between commercial freedom for the operator and ensuring that interests of passengers, taxpayers and the economy are suitably protected.

4. We expect bidders to develop an appropriate vision for the franchise. Bidders will need to take into account value for money, affordability and the deliverability of their plans.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening and Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles have signed off a two-year funding deal to go towards the redevelopment of Northampton Station.

The redevelopment is the first step in a substantial regeneration project in the town which will stimulate the growth of Northampton's economy creating opportunities for thousands of new jobs.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>Northampton deserves a station that will be a brand new 'Gateway' to the town and stimulate the redevelopment of the station area. But more importantly it will give a boost to the Waterside Enterprise Zone and its ambitious plans to unlock the town are potential and encourage more businesses into the area.
 
>After the Northampton Waterside Scheme was designated as an Enterprise Zone last year, Northampton and local MPs, led by Brian Binley, made a great case for extra Government investment in Northampton Station and I'm proud that we have been able to provide this funding.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

>Northamptonshire is using its Enterprise Zone to energise the local economy and boost business. As these new opportunities for innovation and enterprise open up it is vital the infrastructure is in place to match Northampton's ambitions.
 
>This £10million for the Castle Railway station is another step forward in Northampton's resurgence as a place where local communities thrive.

Together with funding from Network Rail and Northamptonshire County Council the Government's contribution will go towards phase one of the redevelopment scheme which includes a new station building and access to the platforms, which will bring benefits to passengers.

The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation can now look at how they can take forward subsequent phases of the £20m redevelopment which will include a new larger car park and release of land for commercial opportunities close to the station.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120508b,Extra carriages mean more seats for commuters,"Commuters will enjoy improved journeys and benefit from 2,400 extra seats during the morning and evening peaks thanks to additional Government funding.","Commuters will enjoy improved journeys and benefit from 2,400 extra seats during the morning and evening peaks thanks to Government funding for an additional 48 rail carriages, Transport Secretary Justine Greening announced today.

The carriages will be used to boost capacity on South West Trains services travelling into Waterloo by an extra 40 carriages in the morning and 37 carriages in the evening.

Justine Greening said:

>I'm determined to do what I can to improve the service and this is great news for passengers. Adding extra carriages to these vital routes will mean more seats for passengers, easing congestion but also helping to boost London's economy.

>With over 1.4 billion rail journeys on the rail network a year, travelling by train is more popular than ever. So, to help meet that demand we are delivering the biggest rail modernisation programme since the Victorian era, with £18 billion committed in this spending period. Today's good news is part of the Government's programme of providing additional capacity on the railway and will benefit passengers across the South West Trains network. So whether you are in Guildford or Portsmouth, Ascot or Basingstoke, Eastleigh or Exeter, Alton or Aldershot you'll be getting better services and more seats -which adds up to a real win-win for passengers.

The extra carriages are Class 456 vehicles which are being cascaded from Southern Railways. They will be introduced into service between March and December 2014. Additional capacity will be provided on 17 separate services travelling in and out of Waterloo together with the creation of two additional 8-car morning services from Raynes Park to London.

### Notes for editors

  1. The additional carriages will facilitate an internal rolling stock cascade which will enable a number of existing services to be lengthened: 
    * Three AM peak suburban services will be lengthened from 8-cars to 10-cars;
    * Two PM peak Guildford services will be lengthened to 12-cars; three suburban services to 10-cars and one Aldershot service to 8-cars;
    * Six main line AM peak services on the Portsmouth, Portsmouth via Eastleigh, Exeter, Alton and Basingstoke service routes to Waterloo will be strengthened;
    * Six mainline PM peak services on the Exeter and Basingstoke service routes from Waterloo will be strengthened.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120308a,Ending inflation-busting rail fare rises,Rail fare increases will be capped at the rate of inflation under plans to help hard-pressed passengers by ensuring the rail industry brings down the cost.,"Rail fare increases will be capped at the rate of inflation under plans to help hard-pressed passengers by ensuring the rail industry brings down the cost of Britain's railways.

A value-for-money study by Sir Roy McNulty concluded last year that inefficiency across the railway industry is costing farepayers and taxpayers £3.5 billion-a-year.

In her Reforming Our Railways: Putting the Customer First Command Paper, Transport Secretary Justine Greening today outlines how the industry will work collaboratively to reduce this £3.5 billion efficiency gap by 2019 with the savings going towards curbing fare increases while also investing in rolling stock and better infrastructure, and lessening the industry's reliance on public subsidy.

Network Rail, with the help of the Office of Rail Regulation, is already on track to deliver a significant tranche of these savings: at least £1.2 billion-a-year savings by 2014 and at least £1.8 billion-a-year by 2019.

The Command Paper commits the government and industry to:

  * Reducing and then ending above-inflation rises in average regulated fares as soon as possible; 
  * Expanding smart ticketing technology so that passengers across England and Wales can enjoy Oyster-style smartcard payment options and more flexible season tickets; 
  * Reforming rail franchises so that operators have to deliver more value and better levels of service for passengers while ensuring taxpayer subsidies are concentrated on safeguarding less profitable routes that remain crucial to communities; 
  * Investing in Britain's capacity to grow jobs and prosperity by funding thousands more carriages, extending electrification of the rail network and redeveloping railway stations; 
  * Strengthening the rail regulator's capacity to improve the passenger experience and oversee the crucial efficiency challenge; 
  * Involving rail workers in our plans to get the industry on a more sustainable footing, to grow jobs and to develop skills; 
  * Empowering passengers by providing better punctuality and real-time travel information. 

Greening said: 

>Inefficiency and waste in the railways is costing hard-pressed farepayers and taxpayers £3.5bn-a-year and I will no longer allow them to be lumbered with this unnecessary burden.

>We are setting out a roadmap for action alongside the industry to root out inefficiency so we can deliver real value-for-money that ends inflation-busting fare rises once and for all.

>Our Command Paper also safeguards community services, commits to continued investment in rail infrastructure and rolling stock, and empowers passengers through better ticketing systems and real-time information.

>It is about building a more efficient and affordable rail network that serves its passengers better, encourages the rail industry to thrive and grow, and ultimately reinvigorates and sustains Britain's economy.

Greening has also welcomed Network Rail's decision to unveil a raft of commitments on improving transparency and accountability - including appointing a public interest director to the Network Rail board to represent the interests of taxpayers.

Network Rail is also granting company members a greater say in board and remuneration decisions, and giving further decision-making powers to its regional directors to make it more responsive and operations-focused. 

On Network Rail's reforms, Greening said: 

>Network Rail is really grasping the nettle in responding to the challenges facing the rail industry. I welcome warmly Network Rail's decision to voluntarily appoint a public interest director to its board and remuneration panel, other governance-strengthening measures, and the steps it has announced to improve performance and efficiency.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120229,Extra trains and faster journey times will boost capacity,Eighty new train carriages set to be introduced on the First TransPennine Express and London Midland networks from December 2013.,"Passengers are on track to benefit from faster, longer trains and over 12,000 extra seats each day on journeys into London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle, Sheffield, Glasgow and Edinburgh, Rail Minister Theresa Villiers announced today.

The capacity boost is being provided thanks to 80 new train carriages set to be introduced on the First TransPennine Express and London Midland networks from December 2013. The two franchises will get 40 extra carriages each.

Theresa Villiers said:

>This is great news for passengers who will get faster, longer trains and more seats. Increasing capacity on some of the busiest routes in the country is a key part of the major programme of rail capacity expansion we have promised to deliver. It is a vital way of responding to passenger concerns about crowding and providing an important stimulus to economic growth.

>As rail travel becomes more popular operators must be able to meet growing demand and these new carriages will enable existing trains to be lengthened. These new trains will also run faster, which means extra train slots will come free, so that London Midland can fit more services into the timetable.

Current London Midland services travel at a maximum speed of 100 mph, but the train operator will modify some of their existing fleet to run at 110 mph - the maximum speed of the new-build trains - creating faster peak and off-peak services into London Euston.

Not only will this mean quicker journey times - the extra speed will help shave up to 25 minutes off existing Crewe to London Euston off-peak services, for example - but the new timings will create space for extra train slots enabling London Midland to boost capacity in the peak even further.

TransPennine Express' 40 new carriages will be used on the Manchester to Scotland route following the electrification of the line between Manchester and the West Coast Main Line south of Wigan. The new carriages will enable existing diesel rolling stock to be redeployed across the franchise to increase capacity into Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle.

The new carriages are part of wider plans by the Government to introduce 2,700 carriages onto the rail network by 2019.

## Notes to editors

  1. The new carriages, which will be built by Siemens, are being procured by London Midland on behalf of both TOCs. The leasing and operation of the additional carriages is being funded by an increase in Government funding to the two TOCs of circa £41m to the planned end of their franchises. The procurement for London Midland was already underway when the electrification of Manchester and the West Coast Main Line south of Wigan was announced. The Government therefore asked London Midland to extend this existing procurement to include trains needed for the Manchester - Scotland services.
  2. The agreement with First TransPennine Express includes the electrification of the depot at Ardwick, Manchester, where those trains will be maintained.
  3. London Midland will receive a total of 40 Class 350/3 carriages while TransPennine Express will receive 40 Class 350/4 carriages. The difference between London Midland and TransPennine Express' carriages is that those on TransPennine Express will be configured slightly differently to meet the needs of long distance and airport passengers.
  4. Of the 40 carriages London Midland will receive, 12 will help deliver an internal rolling stock cascade that will provide additional capacity on the Cross City line in Birmingham. The frequency of peak and off-peak services between Birmingham and Redditch will be increased from two trains per hour to three trains per hour from December 2014. The trains will also enable electric services from Birmingham New Street to be extended to Bromsgrove from May 2015, assuming that the plan to relocate Bromsgrove Station is confirmed and electrification is completed on schedule.
  5. The other 28 London Midland carriages will provide faster peak journeys and extra capacity on services into London Euston from December 2014. For example, the peak journey times between London and Northampton will be reduced by up to 10 minutes and the services between Milton Keynes and London will be reduced by up to 7 minutes. In addition, London Midland will be able to run 3 additional AM peak services and 5 additional PM peak services into and out of London Euston.
  6. Commuters into London Euston will also benefit from faster journeys due to modifications to increase in maximum speed of some of London Midland's existing fleet from 100 mph to 110 mph. The modified trains will deliver faster off-peak services and these are expected to be introduced from December 2012.",2/29/2012,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,Department for Transport,minister-of-state--20,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120217,Have your say on the Essex Thameside rail franchise,Rail passengers and other interested groups in Essex are being asked for their views on how train services could be improved.,"Rail passengers and other interested groups in Essex are being asked for their views on how train services could be improved, Rail Minister Theresa Villiers announced today.

The 12-week consultation will give them the opportunity to say what changes and improvements they would like to see delivered by the new Essex Thameside franchise, which will be renewed in May 2013. Bidders will be invited to take on the new 15 year franchise.

This is part of the Government's shake-up of the rail franchising system to improve services and value for money. In future the Government intends to set demanding 'service quality' standards for train operators to achieve but give them more flexibility on how best to deliver their services. 

Theresa Villiers said:

>We are determined to ensure that the rail franchising process delivers benefits for passengers and better value for money for taxpayers while enhancing the current level of service.

>Over recent years, Whitehall has had too much say in the detail of the way trains are run. I don't believe that micromanagement is the best way to improve services for passengers. I want to protect the passenger by setting demanding outcomes for operators and give more space to the professionals who run our railways to innovate and decide the best way to achieve them. 
 
>This will ensure the rail industry is able to respond more quickly and flexibly to changing passenger concerns. I want passengers and any other groups to tell us what they think about what is important to them. This consultation provides an opportunity for stakeholders to play a key role in shaping the future of the Essex Thameside franchise.

The consultation details what could be expected of the new operator including rolling out smart ticketing technology, improving stations and looking at the possibility of differentiating between 'metro style' - high frequency, high capacity - services near London and 'suburban' services for the longer-distance journeys into Essex.

Operators will get more flexibility over the services they run but the Government intends to continue to mandate the provision of core levels of service. The Department for Transport is also exploring options for measuring operators' performance against 'service quality' standards, based on passenger satisfaction data and 'mystery shopper' visits. 

The reforms will include replacement of the controversial cap and collar system used in a number of franchises over recent years with an alternative mechanism providing better incentives for operators to invest in service improvements.

## Notes to Editors

  * The Essex Thameside consultation, which begins today, closes on the 11 May 2012. The new franchise is due to start on 26 May 2013.

  * Each weekday 356 train services are run on the route, with 279 services on a Saturday and 160 on a Sunday, carrying over 35 million passenger journeys and 585 million passenger miles per year.

In addition, a long franchise of up to 15 years for the West Coast Main Line will encourage the new operator to invest in improvements at stations and help drive down excessive costs. Other benefits for passengers will include the introduction of smart ticketing technology, Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said today as she launched the Invitation to Tender.

Theresa Villiers said:

>Passengers will welcome the 28,000 additional seats this new franchise will deliver everyday on what is becoming one of the UK's busiest rail lines. A longer, more flexible franchise will encourage private sector investment, for example in improving stations. It will also promote greater efficiency to enable improvements to be made whilst driving down costs.

>The introduction of new requirements on passenger satisfaction will mean the operator has to focus strongly on the issues that matter most to passengers; and the roll out of smart ticketing will provide many more passengers with greater convenience and the sort of advantages already enjoyed in the capital.

The new franchise will run from December 2012 to March 2026, with an option for the Department to extend for up to 20 months.

A total of 106 new 'Pendolino' carriages are being added to the West Coast route, enabling four new train sets to be introduced and 31 existing trains to be lengthened from nine to 11 carriages.

A new flexible franchise agreement gives bidders the flexibility to vary timetables on individual days of the week to cater for changes in demand, enabling the future operator to provide better services for passengers, whilst protecting existing services by specifying a minimum number of stops at each station.

### Notes to Editors

  1. Virgin Trains' existing contract to run services on the West Coast Main Line expires on 9 December 2012.
  2. Details published of the new franchise that will take over from 9 December 2012, are set out by the [Department in an Invitation to Tender (ITT)](/publications/rail-passenger-franchise-intercity-west-coast)
  3. The Invitation to Tender follows a consultation designed to give the public and stakeholders a chance to have their say on what they wanted from the new franchise.
  4. The proposed Train Service Specification for new Inter City West Coast represents a relaxation from the rigid timetable specification of the past, while retaining obligations that protect the key outcomes for passengers and taxpayers, such as principal first and last trains and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day. This marks a significant shift from the micro-management that has prevented operators from maximising capacity and reacting to the changing demands of their passengers in the past.
  5. The four shortlisted bidders to run the franchise from December 2012 are Abellio, First Group, Keolis/SNCF and Virgin.
  6. Bids for the franchise are expected to be received by May 2012 and the new operator will be announced in August 2012. The new InterCity West Coast franchise will run until March 2026, with an option for the Department to extend up to 20 months.
  7. Over the course of the next year, three new 600-seat Pendolino trains will be added to the line. This is in addition to the new Pendolino which entered service in July this year. Also, 31 existing Pendolinos will be lengthened from 9 to 11 carriages, increasing the number of standard class seats on each train by almost 50%, from 320 to 470. In all, 106 new carriages are being introduced on the route making 28,000 extra seats available each day, an increase of 25%. The latest Pendolino train, which will eventually enhance capacity on the West Coast Main Line was delivered earlier this week on the 16 January.
  8. When the Government set out its plans on franchise reform, it acknowledged that each franchise contract needs to reflect the different characteristics of the lines and services it covers. Therefore the requirements set out in the West Coast Franchise may not necessarily become standard terms in every subsequent rail franchise.
  9. The Government is committed to getting all possible capacity from the WCML. However, Network Rail's own forecasts show that the scope for further upgrades will soon be exhausted and the line will be full by the mid-2020s. So while 28,000 extra seats will be provided from the start of this new franchise, the Government considers HS2 - a new high speed rail network from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds - to be the only long term solution to capacity problems. HS2 will provide the future rail capacity that Britain needs and provide relief to the WCML. The new West Coast franchise has been timed to conclude in 2026 as the first phase of HS2 opens.
  10. The ITT for the InterCity West Coast franchise follows the current agreed regulated fares policy as set out in the 2011 Comprehensive Spending Review - a rise in 2012 of RPI+1% and RPI+3% for 2013 and 2014, returning to RPI+1% thereafter. Over the long term we are committed to reducing the cost of running the railways and the goal of ending the era of above-inflation fare increases.

Designation of the line between Chester and Manchester via Northwich will enable train companies to work more closely with community rail partnerships to better design services to meet local needs.

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>I want to encourage communities to become more closely involved with their railways to help create the services and stations passengers deserve. 

>That's why I am delighted to announce this latest community rail designation.. Today's designation is a major step towards helping the Mid Cheshire Community Rail Partnership work closely with local groups to provide innovative and more cost effective rail services for their community.

Ian Bevan, Managing Director of Northern Rail, which runs services on the route, said:

>Northern welcomes the designation of the Mid Cheshire line as a community rail service. This line plays an important role in the area and designation will assist in identifying innovative ways of developing this line to the benefit of local people and visitors to the region. The community rail partnership for the line is already doing a great job and this will enable it to go from strength to strength.

John Oates, Chair of the Mid Cheshire Community Rail Partnership said:

>Community Rail Service Designation for the Mid Cheshire Line will help us to achieve even more for passengers on our line. We look forward to having greater flexibility and the opportunity to work more closely with the rail industry, users, local councils and others to maximise the benefit of rail services and station improvements in Mid Cheshire.

The new trains are to be built by Derby-based train maker Bombardier following a procurement competition run by Southern.

The Department for Transport and Southern have agreed to vary the franchise agreement to support this procurement.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>This deal for more than a hundred new carriages is great news for rail passengers and brilliant news for Bombardier and Derby.

>It lands Bombardier with a crucial train order and I look forward to Bombardier workers in Derby being among the winners of this important deal.

>This deal, helped along by my department, shows my determination to invest in Britain's railways: our support for Southern will boost capacity while helping British jobs. I can't think of a better outcome.

The funding was earmarked by Greening in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement last month but is only being announced today following the signing of the contract between Bombardier and Southern.

The deal is expected to be formally announced today (Weds) to the stock exchange in Toronto, where Bombardier Transportation UK Ltd.'s parent company is based.

Southern Railways' passengers will experience the capacity benefits when the new carriages enter service in December 2013. The fresh order for rolling stock is also expected to have positive knock-on effects for Bombardier workers in Derby and elsewhere.

Southern operate train services in South London, Surrey, Sussex and Kent .The agreement that has been reached between Southern and the Government also provides certainty to Southern about the expiry date of the franchise, which has been fixed at 25 July 2015. This provides clarity to any parties that may be interested in the new Thameslink franchise that commences in September 2013, with services that Southern currently operate being amalgamated into the Thameslink franchise in July 2015.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111223,New platform and 60 extra carriages for Waterloo commuters,Rail passengers are set to benefit from extra carriages to ease overcrowding and the former Waterloo International Station,"Passengers on some of the country's busiest rail routes are set to benefit from extra carriages to ease overcrowding and the former Waterloo International Station is to be reopened for commuter services, Transport Secretary Justine Greening announced today.

The 60 extra carriages are being added thanks to Government funding for South West Trains to lease the vehicles. Their arrival will mean that services from Windsor, Weybridge (via Staines), Portsmouth, Southampton, Eastleigh, Reading, Hounslow and Alton into Waterloo can be lengthened and additional services will also run from Reading.  Their deployment will mean that platform 20 at the former Waterloo International Terminal will come back into use from 2014. 

The carriages - which will allow around 8,000 extra peak-time passengers into Waterloo every morning - will begin arriving from May 2013, with all new services in place by July 2014.

Justine Greening said:

>Passengers travelling into Waterloo have to suffer some of the busiest trains in the country, with sardine-can like conditions on many peak-time services.

>These extra carriages will help ease those conditions, while opening an extra platform will provide space for additional trains to run. But our plans do not stop here. We are now embarked on one of the largest programmes of rail investment since the Victorian era and we expect to introduce further carriages on Waterloo routes and bring more platforms into use in the future.

Network Rail is continuing to progress plans to make further use of Waterloo and Waterloo International to cope with future demand.

## Notes for editors 

  * The additional carriages will enable trains on the following routes to be lengthened from 8 to 10 cars: Waterloo-Windsor & Eton (Riverside), Waterloo-Weybridge via Brentford and Staines, Waterloo-Hounslow via both Richmond and Brentford.  This will be achieved through the introduction of 60 Class 460 vehicles. 
  * An internal cascade will provide two additional Reading and one further Hounslow peak service into Waterloo; and further lengthen seven South West mainline services. South West Trains expect to complete the rolling stock deployment by July 2014, with the first 10-car service operating from May 2013. 

The seven mainline services SWT expect to be strengthened are as follows:

  * Morning peak
  * Southampton Airport Parkway to Waterloo (8 car to 12 car in high peak)
  * Portsmouth Harbour to Waterloo via Eastleigh (5 car to 10 car in the peak) 
  * Southampton Central to Waterloo (4 car to 5 car in the peak)
  * Evening peak
  * Waterloo to Poole (5 car to 8 car) 
  * Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour via Eastleigh (5 car to 8 car)
  * Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour via Eastleigh (8 car to 10 car)
  * Waterloo to Alton (8 car to 12 car)

A consultation launched today will give passengers, local councils and other interested groups the chance to say what improvements and changes they want to see delivered by the new Great Western rail franchise, which is set to be renewed in 2013.

Theresa Villiers said:

>This consultation launch represents an excellent opportunity for passengers to make their mark and tell us what changes they think should be made. This is their chance to tell us how train services can better serve passengers.

>The franchise will be one of the first to be let on a 15 year term. We will expect the train operator chosen to run the franchise to provide high quality services, deliver improved levels of passenger satisfaction, roll out smart ticketing for thousands more journeys, and invest in improvements that will benefit passengers.

>The winning bidder will also need to build successful working relationships with Network Rail aimed at improving efficiency and reducing the cost of running the railways. The coming years will also see a major improvements to Great Western rail infrastructure.

The new franchisee will be responsible for ensuring that overall passenger experience improves throughout the life of the franchise. There will need to be improvements in: service quality, retailing and provision of information to customers, particularly during times of planned and unplanned disruption. The franchisee will also need to ensure that train services perform to the highest practical reliability and punctuality standards.

The successful bidder is expected to oversee the introduction of new Intercity Express trains on the route, providing more capacity than the ageing High Speed Trains they are planned to replace on parts of the franchise. They will also oversee a major increase in capacity on routes into London Paddington - with the number of peak times seats set to increase from around 17,000 today to almost 20,000 in 2019 - and will manage the franchise through major upgrade and electrification work to the Great Western Mainline.

The new franchisee will also take on greater responsibility for maintenance and upkeep of station facilities, ensuring they are attractive gateways to the railway system, as well as being modern, user-friendly interchanges with other modes of transport. Bidders are being encouraged to consider how fares on the route could be simplified and the opportunities for new retailing methods to make buying a ticket easier, such as 'print at home' services.

In addition, the franchise will be structured in a way which could allow the transfer of certain responsibilities to local authorities after the awarding of the franchise as the Government will soon be consulting on decentralising some responsibilities for local rail services.

## Notes for editors

  1. The Great Western Franchise Replacement consultation, which starts today, closes on 31 March 2012. The Department for Transport will produce a summary of the consultation responses alongside the Invitation to Tender, which will be published in May 2012. The winning bidder will be announced in December 2012 with the new franchise set to start in April 2013.
  2. The new operator will be expected to manage the franchise alongside planned upgrades to infrastructure and services, including the provision of extra carriages, the redevelopment of Reading station, the electrification of the line, the Crossrail project, the Intercity Express Programme and the Swindon-Kemble line redoubling.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111206c,Government boosts preparations to tackle severe weather and avoid winter travel misery,Transport Secretary Justine Greening announced today a £16m investment in third rail heating as part of a £38m programme to make sure the rail network is better prepared for severe bad weather this winter.,"Transport Secretary Justine Greening announced today a £16m investment in third rail heating as part of a £38m programme to make sure the rail network is better prepared for severe bad weather this winter.  

One of the lessons learnt after three successive severe winters was the need to increase the resilience of the railway to heavy snow, particularly on routes relying on the third rail. 

The Government is funding an extensive rolling programme to install third rail heating being carried out by Network Rail across London and the South East. 

The programme, part of the infrastructure improvements plan announced in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement, will cover 116,000m of track and cover 421 sites where trains require most traction across the Kent, Sussex and Wessex routes.

To ensure that we go into this winter better prepared, equipment has already been installed at about 85 per cent of the locations and is due to be in place at the remaining sites by January 2012. 

The Transport Secretary also published today a cross-Government research study examining options for strengthening winter resilience against a backdrop of recent winter travel disruption that has cost businesses and individuals around £280m a day. The review, which involved Chief Economists and Chief Scientists at DfT, DECC and DEFRA, examined the case for greater investment in a variety of different measures to enhance future winter resilience. 

The report shows that we have got the balance of investment in winter preparedness broadly correct. 

But it found scope to do more in a number of areas, including boosting rail network resilience and showing there was a good case to introduce third rail heating south of London, where weather disruption was greatest last year due to dependence on third rail train power. 

Justine Greening also announced that she had asked the UK Roads Board to explore further measures to make better use of salt, equipment and infrastructure to keep local highways open and safe during severe winter weather. She will also look at the case for increased investment in the Met Office's super-computing capacity that could ultimately provide improved information on the likelihood and impact of severe weather and support better long-term planning. 

Justine Greening visited a rail depot in Tonbridge today to see some of the winter preparations that the rail industry is putting in place and met managers from Southeastern and Network Rail. Apart from the third rail improvements, Network Rail is expanding its fleet of snow clearance and ice treatment trains to a total of 20 and the rail sector is improving its communications with passengers.  

Justine Greening said: 

>Severe cold weather will always cause some disruption but the Government has worked with our industry partners to minimise the impact on passengers and businesses in future.  Both airports and the railway are much better prepared than in the past and our current salt stock in Britain is over 2.7m tonnes. Today I am announcing £16m of investment in our rail infrastructure to help keep trains moving in snow and ice.
 
>But I'm also asking the industry to raise its game and communicate better with passengers in severe weather. However much resilience train operators have built in, when problems do occur it's a lack of information that makes delays so frustrating and makes it more difficult for passengers to plan their journeys.

The Secretary of State has in recent weeks seen for herself some of the improvements to winter resilience this year, at Heathrow Airport and Felixstowe Port, for example. Yesterday the Regional Cabinet in Ipswich also discussed plans for winter preparedness this year. 

## Notes to Editors

  1. The report [Winter Resilience in Transport: an assessment of the case for additional investment](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/winter-resilience-in-transport) was published today.
  2. The Transport Secretary has asked the UK Roads Board to consider further road salt and local highways issues in the report, including gritter calibration and operator training, the potential for local authorities to share storage facilities and the cost effectiveness of setting up an advisory service to help local authorities identify whether they could achieve cost savings by investing in equipment needed for pre-wet treatments. 
  3. Heathrow and Gatwick airports have made significant investments in more snow and ice clearance capacity and improved their operational procedures. Heathrow has already committed to investing over £30m to improve resilience and Gatwick has invested £8m in its snow and ice clearance fleets following last winter. Both airports have significantly increased their stocks of de-icer.
  4. Across Government, action is being taken to plan for winter disruption. The Met Office has recently improved its National Severe Weather Service, allowing more targeted forecast of potential impacts from severe weather this winter and providing a range of forecasts out to 30 days publicly available on its website. The Department of Health has a Cold Weather Plan, as part of efforts to prevent illness and injury in cold weather. The Department for Communities and Local Government is liaising with local authorities to ensure access to road salt for all strategic consumers including police, ports, hospitals and services for the vulnerable.
  5. Current salt stock for Great Britain at the end of October 2011 is 2,755,000 tonnes, including strategic stockpiles of 539,000 tonnes and Highways Agency operational salt stock.
  6. The Government has also joined up with voluntary sector partners and industry bodies to encourage individual, families and communities to think about what winter preparations they need to make. The ""Getting Ready for Winter"" initiative highlights some simple and straight forward advice. Including top tips on keeping warm, healthy and safe this winter. The get Ready for winter web page is [ available on Directgov](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/Features/DG_WP199639)
  7. The Department for Transport is exploring with Transport Scotland, the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association how to broker agreement across a group of businesses and local authorities in England and Scotland to trial the temporary use of snow ploughs attached to certain types of heavy duty vehicles to help clear important routes between key distribution centres and the strategic road network. Where necessary, Ministers will consider relaxing certain weights and dimensions legislation to facilitate this.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111206d,Passengers to benefit from access improvements at stations,More than £37.5m of Government funding to make stations more easily  accessible under a new Access for All Mid-Tier programme.,"Rail passengers are set to benefit from easier journeys at stations across the country after Rail Minister, Norman Baker, approved more than £37.5m of Government funding to make stations more easily accessible under a new Access for All Mid-Tier programme. Upgrades to the stations will include new lifts, ramps and raised ""easy access humps"" on platforms as well as new accessible toilets. 

Norman Baker said:

>Rail journeys don't start and end at the carriage door. For many people - whether they are elderly, disabled or parents with prams - getting from the station entrance and on to the train can be the hardest part of their trip.
 
>Despite the need to reduce the deficit, we are committed to improving access to stations across the country as this can make a huge difference to people's lives.  In recognition of this, and of the large number of high quality bids we received for this funding, we are today announcing projects worth more than double the £17m budget we originally allocated to this programme.

>We are also adding £2m a year to the current £5m allocated each year to train operating companies which will be used to fund more minor works and releasing £57m of funding earlier than planned to Network Rail so that they can accelerate the delivery of the main Access for All programme.

Major improvements will take place at Acocks Green, Aldershot, Alton, Barry Island, Bearsted, Bexleyheath, Birchwood, Blackhorse Road, Chirk, Crayford, Crystal Palace, Edmonton Green, Ewell East, Hackbridge, Hampstead Heath, Kensal Rise, Keynsham, Llandaf, London Paddington, Machynlleth, Nailsea and Blackwell, Paddock Wood, Queen's Road Peckham, Radyr, Redhill, Richmond, St. Austell, St. Neots, South Tottenham, Stratford, Stratford-upon-Avon, Stevenage, Swindon, Theale, Wakefield Westgate, Wendover, West Hampstead, Wokingham and Ystrad Mynach stations.  Network Rail will also receive funding to add tactile edge paving at 27 stations and £5m to provide ""easy access humps"" at a number of stations to reduce the stepping distance between the platform and the train. 

The improvements are being funded as part of the Department for Transport's Access for All scheme which aims to improve access to railway stations. All work at the stations will be completed by March 2014.

A further £2m a year for the next three years will also be added to the existing Access for All small schemes budget.  Small Schemes funding is allocated to each train operator to deliver more minor access improvements at local stations and this additional funding restores the budget to its pre-Spending Review level of £7m a year. 

We have also today confirmed that £57m of Access for All funding, currently allocated to rail Control Period 5, will be brought forward into the current Control Period.  This will allow Network Rail to deliver accessible routes at 27 stations earlier than currently planned.

She met representatives from the local authorities and stakeholders, including the East West Rail consortium, to hear how they will work with Network Rail to complete a project which independent experts claim will create 12,000 new jobs and a £38m boost to the region's economy. 

This visit to Bicester Town Station follows the Chancellor's [Autumn Statement](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/as2011_index.htm) last week when the Government confirmed its commitment to support the rail link between Oxford, Bicester, Aylesbury, Milton Keynes and Bedford. 

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said: 

>This is an exciting new project which demonstrates the Government's commitment to stimulating economic growth across the UK. 

>As well as growing the regional economy by £38m the project could create 12,000 new jobs. It will also deliver benefits to passengers through improved journey times and provide a significant addition to our country's rail network.

>In addition to helping to boost the regional economy, the new link will slash journey times between Oxford, Milton Keynes and Bedford to under one hour.

Taking the train from Oxford to Bedford currently involves travelling into central London and takes 2h30m. Travelling by rail from Oxford to Milton Keynes can also currently take up to 2h30m.

Network Rail will be working with local stakeholders to develop the scheme further. Subject to a satisfactory local contribution and business case, the Government will announce how it will take the plans forward in the summer of 2012. Provided planning consents are granted, construction work could start in 2015 and be ready for train services during 2017.

## Notes for editors

1. The line is likely to be used by a mixture of local and long-distance passenger trains and some freight trains. 

2. The exact pattern of services has yet to be determined, but the East West rail consortium has proposed an hourly train service from Reading or Didcot to Bedford via Oxford and Bletchley.

Passengers in the Thames Valley will benefit from nearly 4,500 additional seats each day into and out of London Paddington. The majority of these services will also provide additional capacity into Reading.

The extra seats are being added thanks to Government funding for an additional 48 carriages on First Great Western services which run through Reading and the Thames Valley and into London Paddington as well as in Bristol and the far south west of England.

Theresa Villiers said:

>We are determined to tackle overcrowding and provide better, more comfortable journeys for passengers. These extra carriages will enable existing services to be lengthened which will significantly increase their capacity.

>Completion of the vital Crossrail and Thameslink projects in London will also provide more capacity for passengers. In addition, we are investing in the electrification of the Great Western Main Line between London, Bristol, Cardiff, Oxford and Newbury and a massive reconstruction of Reading Station.

>Adding carriages to some of the busiest routes in the country is a key part of the major programme of rail capacity expansion which we have promised to deliver. This is a vital way to respond to passenger concerns about crowding and provides important support for economic growth.

The extra carriages, which are planned to come into service in time for the London 2012 Olympic Games, will be deployed on morning and evening peak services serving the capital and commuting towns such as Bristol, Reading, Basingstoke, Ealing Broadway, Slough and Maidenhead. Two of the 48 carriages will be used to increase capacity on crowded trains between Truro and Falmouth and Exmouth and Torbay.

### Notes for editors

  1. The extra carriages being provided thanks to Government support will see 15 Mark III buffet-car carriages converted to standard class to provide longer trains on services into Bristol, Reading and London Paddington.
  2. 25 Class 180 carriages will be leased and will then release suburban rolling stock to enable shorter distance commuter trains to be lengthened into Paddington.
  3. Six Class 150 carriages will used on services running between Reading and Basingstoke and thereby allow the stock currently on that route to lengthen suburban trains on the Thames Valley into Paddington.
  4. Two Class 150 carriages will be added to Bristol services allowing two Class 153s to be cascaded onto Truro to Falmouth and Exmouth to Torbay services.
  5. The total cost of providing these services until the expected end of the First Great Western franchise in April 2013 is £28.9m.
  6. The extra carriages will create a total of 2,266 seats in the morning three hour peak and 2,233 seats in the evening three hour peak into and out of London Paddington.
  7. Other locations will also benefit including Reading, which will see 1,483 extra seats in the morning peak and 1,731 extra seats in the evening peak , Bristol will see 588 extra seats in the morning peak and 336 extra seats in the evening peak. Truro and Torbay will see an increase of 271 seats in the morning peak and 375 seats in the evening peak.
  8. The carriages providing additional capacity to Falmouth, Truro and Torbay are being part funded by Devon and Cornwall County Councils as well as a contribution from the Devon & Cornwall Community Rail Partnership.",11/22/2011,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,Department for Transport,minister-of-state--20,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111110b,Your chance to cut rail red tape,Rail passengers and businesses are set to benefit as Rail Minister Theresa Villiers today pledges to crack down on unnecessary red tape.,"Rail passengers and businesses are set to benefit as Rail Minister Theresa Villiers today pledges to crack down on unnecessary red tape.

Nearly 200 rail transport regulations have today been placed on the Red Tape Challenge website - a Government-wide site aimed at reducing bureaucracy. They will remain there for consultation for four weeks. The Challenge asks everyone whether they think that a regulation is well designed and provides vital protection or is badly designed, badly implemented or simply a bad idea. 

Among the regulations that the Government is asking the public to comment on are the National Rail Conditions of Carriage - the terms and conditions passengers must adhere to when travelling on a train.

Other examples include the requirement for the Secretary of State to approve train operations on all sections of a line, the speed of those operations and a variety of other conditions for tramways and other minor railways including heritage operations.

The review also targets a number of arcane and obsolete regulations on the statute books that could run the risk of eroding public confidence in regulations. For example, there are regulations in force covering closures on railway lines which no longer exist and various exemption orders which have expired.

Theresa Villiers said:

>We want everyone - including passengers, businesses and volunteer groups - to get involved and help reduce the number of badly thought out and obsolete regulations in our country.

>The Red Tape Challenge is an ideal opportunity to consider innovative ways of delivering better rail services. We are already working on delivering less prescriptive rail franchises and taking forward reforms to help the rail industry to reduce costs.

>By reducing red tape, we can also free businesses to compete, create jobs and unleash a private sector-led recovery.

Business and Enterprise Minister Mark Prisk said:

>Since the Red Tape Challenge was launched in April, we have received more than 25,000 comments and proposals made by the public and businesses. Already this has resulted in plans for significant changes to legislation - we have looked at 378 pieces of regulation and announced plans to remove or simplify 220 of these.

>I look forward to seeing the results of the 200 rail transport regulations under the spotlight. This process can only result in a more efficient rail network, which will be good news for all rail users and growth in the wider economy.

Experienced 'Sector Champions' will provide expert knowledge on the issues faced by those on the shop floor during the Red Tape Challenge.

Graham Smith, Secretary of the Rail Delivery Group said:

>An expanding railway also has to be an efficient railway. The rail industry is tackling a range of initiatives that will increase efficiency and improve value for money for the passenger, freight shipper and taxpayer that will unlock further growth in rail use.

>Many of the barriers to that greater efficiency can be found in the bureaucracy, red tape and regulations that delay, or even prevent, improvements to Britain's railways. Removing the bureaucracy, discarding the red tape and scrapping unnecessary regulations will help the rail industry to provide an even better service to its customers.

David Morgan and Mark Smith of the Heritage Railway Association said:

>The Heritage Railway Association fully understands that regulation is as essential for us as for any sector of the industry. Our challenge will be to identify that which is appropriate for our operations and retain it whilst the inappropriate, unnecessary and redundant is dismantled.

The overall aim is to remove barriers to economic growth and increase individual freedoms. The presumption is that regulations will go, unless it can be justified why a regulation should be kept.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111027b,"West Coast passengers in line for 28,000 extra seats as franchise extension signed",Passengers using the busy West Coast Main Line are set to benefit from extra carriages and more seats from April next year.,"Passengers using the busy West Coast Main Line are set to benefit from extra carriages and more seats from April next year Rail Minister Theresa Villiers has announced, after the Government signed an extension to Virgin Trains' existing contract to operate services on the line.

Services on the line - which stretches from London to Glasgow serving Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool and North Wales - will now be run by Virgin Trains until December 2012. Over the course of the extension three new 600-seat Pendolino trains will be added to the line. This is in addition to the new Pendolino which entered service in July this year. Also, 31 existing Pendolinos will be lengthened from 9 to 11 carriages, increasing the number of standard class seats on each train by almost 50%, from 320 to 470. In all, 106 new carriages are being introduced on the route making 28,000 extra seats available each day, an increase of 25%.

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>The West Coast Main Line is one of our busiest and most important rail arteries. Keeping the existing operator in place while these new trains and carriages are introduced should help ensure they are introduced smoothly onto the network so passengers reap the benefits as soon as possible.

>When this extension expires in December 2012, the Government will have completed a competition for a new operator to run services on the line under a new longer style of franchise which gives the operator more incentive to invest and more freedom to innovate and deliver for passengers.

>These extra seats are great news for passengers, but in the longer term, even with these improvements, the route is expected to be full by 2024. This is why we are considering proposals for a high speed rail line between London, the West Midlands, Manchester, Leeds and potentially beyond.

The Department announced its intention to seek an extension to Virgin Trains' existing contract in May 2011. At the same time the Department published details of how the new West Coast franchise that will take over in December 2012 will look, in the form of a draft Invitation To Tender. The new franchise will run from December 2012 to March 2026 with an option for the Department to extend up to 20 months.

The Government is currently considering responses to its consultation on proposals for a new high speed rail network and will announce its decision by the end of the year.

## Notes to editors

  * Virgin Trains' existing contract to run services on the West Coast Main Line would have expired on 31 March 2012. The extension signed today will see it continue to 9 December 2012.
  * Details published of the new franchise that will take over from 9 December 2012, were set out by the Department in a draft Invitation to Tender (ITT) published in May 2011. The draft ITT can be accessed at: [http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/rail-passenger-franchise-intercity-west-coast](/publications/rail-passenger-franchise-intercity-west-coast)
  * The proposed Train Service Specification for new Inter City West Coast franchise - which will begin in December 2012 once the franchise extension announced today expires - represents a relaxation from the rigid timetable specification of the past, while retaining obligations that protect the key elements of service, such as principal first and last trains and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day. This marks a significant shift from the micro-management that has prevented operators from maximising capacity and reacting to the changing demands of their passengers in the past.
  * The DfT expects to publish the final invitation to tender for the new longer intercity west coast franchise in January 2012. The four shortlisted bidders to run the franchise from December 2012 are Abellio, First Group, Keolis/SNCF and Virgin.

The new operator will also be required to install electrical car points at 20 stations.
  * The new operator will also run a six month trial of a scheduled bus service between Saffron Walden and Audley End station, the introduction of a PlusCab service that will allow customers to book a taxi from 45 stations with pre-agreed fares based on a zonal pricing structure and a complimentary refreshments service for first class passengers on the London to Norwich and Stansted Express services.
  * Information desks will be built at Cambridge, Norwich and Stansted Airport, and six new kiosks will be built at Bishops Stortford, Chelmsford, Colchester (two), Ipswich and Stratford. A new information desk will also be installed at Liverpool Street Station.
  * Two new customer panels will be established and the new operator will also recruit a team of multi-lingual volunteers to provide information to customers in or around affected stations during the Olympics and Paralympics. Meanwhile a Smartphone App specifically for the Olympics will be developed which will provide real-time service information and directions to stations.
  * A total of 141 stations will be refreshed and the whole the train fleet will be deep cleaned (except the class 379s), including all surfaces and floor coverings, toilets and lighting. In addition the interior of the class 321 units will be refreshed and CCTV will be fitted to 68 class 321 vehicles.
  * Although Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been announced as the winning bidder for the franchise, they will not be formally appointed until 1 November because of the requirement for a procurement standstill period.

Leeds is the second busiest station outside London with around 36 million passengers a year and the area to the immediate south has seen major new office accommodation such as Bridgewater Place, as well as new residential and leisure facilities including the Mint Hotel. A new southern entrance will for the first time provide direct access to this area from the station, benefitting around 20 per cent of passengers and helping to facilitate future development.

The new entrance is being jointly funded by the Department for Transport, Metro and Leeds City Council. It will comprise a concourse deck over the River Aire within a visually iconic enclosed building. Subject to a successful Transport and Works Act Order, the new entrance is expected to open in summer 2014.

Visiting the site of the southern entrance with co-funders Metro, Theresa Villiers said:

>Despite the urgent need to tackle the deficit, targeted investment to support growth remains a Government priority. A southern entrance at Leeds Station will greatly improve access to an existing area of regeneration that has already transformed the immediate station surroundings, and promises to add an iconic new structure to this key gateway to the city. I look forward to seeing this project develop.

Cllr James Lewis, Metro's Chairman said:

>Leeds Station is at the heart of the city and the city region. Passenger numbers using this busy station are growing and set to rise even further, and providing a second access at the southern side of the station will ease congestion for people using the existing entrances.

>This new entrance, whose striking design was well-received design by people during consultation, will encourage business, residential and leisure growth south of the river.

## Notes to Editors

  * The estimated total cost of the scheme is £14.4m. In reapproving the scheme, DfT agreed to provide up to a maximum of £12.4m towards scheme construction costs, with a further £0.5m coming from Leeds City Council. Metro are providing £1.5m for the development costs.
  * A public consultation during summer 2009 showed a very high level of support for the scheme, with 96% of respondents supporting the idea for a new southern entrance for the station.
  * Construction of the new entrance is expected to begin in summer 2013 and the entrance is expected to be open in 2014, subject to the planning process.",10/20/2011,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,Department for Transport,minister-of-state--20,

### Notes to Editors

1. Today's announcement grants the Reading station highway improvements a ""Full Approval"" following the re-confirmed ""Conditional Approval"" granted in December 2010.

2. The works are being led by Reading Borough Council in coordination with Network Rail.

3. The project previously approved in March 2010 by the previous Government was a £16.4m package of highway improvements to which the previous Department had allocated up to £15m. Following last year's Spending Review, the Department encouraged the Council to review the scheme to reduce the Department's contribution and increase the local contribution.

4. Reading decided to defer planned improvements at the junctions of Portman Road/Oxford Road and Caversham Road/Richfield Avenue until a later date and those works will be funded from other sources.

5. The Council has contained the project's costs within the budget set in December 2010 by value engineering the project in order to reduce costs and ensure delivery within budget.

6. Works are due to start in October and complete by spring 2014.

7. This project will provide additional benefits to those being delivered by the separate project to rebuild and enlarge the station led by Network Rail under a remit issued by the Department. The latter involves the provision of additional platforms, along with a new viaduct and underpasses to remove a number of conflicting train movements which occur at present. The design is compatible with the electrification of the Great Western Main Line between Paddington, Oxford, Newbury, Bristol and Cardiff and the deployment of the new Inter City Express train fleet by 2017. A new train care depot is also being constructed to accommodate both diesel and electric trains. The new station is designed to manage twice the present levels of business and the whole scheme is planned for completion by 2016. The total cost is £850m.",10/4/2011,expanding-and-improving-the-rail-network,,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--30,

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110920,Green light for trams,Light rail has a future in this country if capital costs can be reduced,"Light rail has a future in this country if capital costs can be reduced Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said today as he published a review looking at how trams can be more cost effective in the future.

Despite tram passenger numbers being at record levels, high building costs have meant that even where passenger forecasts may justify its consideration, light rail has often not been seen as an affordable option for local transport authorities.

Recommendations from the review for local authorities and industry include

  * to implement a new project design of light rail systems which is uniform across the industry; 
  * to look at lower cost schemes overseas to see whether they could be adopted in this country; and
  * to set up a 'centre of procurement excellence' to advise on the best procurement options.

Norman Baker said:

>Light rail is good for passengers, good for local economics, good for the local environment and it's a mode of public transport that passengers really enjoy using - that is why I'm committed to doing everything we can to bring costs down to make it a viable option for more communities. 
 
>In the past light rail systems have been seen as expensive and an unaffordable option for local authorities to pursue - I initiated this review so we can get to the nub of the problem. 
 
>I now urge all parts of the light rail sector to work together on implementing these recommendations and I look forward to working with them towards these exciting opportunities.

Findings show that light rail has the potential to provide high capacity transport into and around major conurbations which reduces congestion, supports growth and improves regeneration opportunities. The Department will therefore hold a summit of the light rail sector to agree a sector-led implementation plan for getting light rail on the right track. 

The report found that one of the main reasons for high construction costs is the need to divert and locate utilities which lie under the road where the tram is to be built e.g. water and gas main pipes. The Department for Transport will now launch a consultation to seek views on how this system can be simplified and ultimately how costs can be reduced costs.

**Notes to Editors**

The light rail review report 'Green Light for Light Rail' published today is available at: [www.dft.gov.uk/publications/green-light-for-light-rail/](/publications/green-light-for-light-rail/)

The terms of reference for this review were:

  * what are the key cost drivers for light rail?; and 
  * what steps could be taken to help make this mode more cost effective in the future?

In the latest light rail and tram statistics published in August 2011, passenger journeys in England for light rail and tram systems have shown to have increased by 5.5 per cent between 2009/10 and 2010/11 with 196.5 million passenger journeys in 2010/11.  This represents the highest number of passenger journeys to date.

There are eight tramway/light rail systems currently in operation in England. These are in Croydon, London's Docklands, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Tyne and Wear, Nottingham and Blackpool. 

There are currently a number of extensions to the Manchester Metrolink system under construction, funded with Central Government support and which will see Metrolink extended to Oldham and Rochdale, as well as Ashton-Under-Lyne and East Didsbury. Further extensions to the system are under active consideration by Transport for Greater Manchester, the local transport authority, using local sources of funding. In addition, the upgrade to the Blackpool and Fleetwood tramway is well underway and is nearing completion, as well as work commencing on the modernisation of the Tyne and Wear Metro. 

Further extensions to existing networks are also close to final approval. These include extensions to the Midland Metro Line One into Birmingham city centre and to the Nottingham Express Transit system. In addition a new tram system in Edinburgh is being developed.

Today's report builds on action already taken since May 2010 in support of light rail, including:

  * removing the requirement for light rail schemes to have a higher proportion of local contributions compared to other modes;
  * providing funding support to a number of light rail schemes; and 
  * supporting a tram train pilot in South Yorkshire and working with Hertfordshire County Council/Network Rail on the possibility of converting the St Albans Abbey Line to light rail.

The review has considered evidence from the various inquiries that have taken place previously.  This includes findings from the reports published by the National Audit Office, the Transport Select Committee and the All Party Parliamentary Light Rail Group. Further evidence was also provided by other organisations such as UKTram and scheme promoters, as well as research on costs of major infrastructure projects undertaken overseas for which the Department is very grateful.

>While Network Rail will be carrying out important improvement works in some areas, 95% of normal train services will be running this weekend which is around 1,700 more trains than ran last August Bank Holiday.

>Of course everyone should still allow plenty of time for their journeys and plan well in advance, but a lot of work is going into keeping Britain moving this weekend.

In spite of intense pressure on the public finances the Government is undertaking one of the biggest programmes of rail improvements since the Victorian era. These include a green-light for Crossrail, Thameslink and a programme of additional carriages for our most rail crowded lines. 

For most travellers there should be no disruption because of the improvement works. But, as always, travellers should check with their train operator or national rail enquiries before they travel.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110810,"8,800 extra spaces for busy trains on key routes","More space for passengers created on key commuter services in Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle.","Space for up to an extra 8,800 rail passengers is being created on key commuter services in Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle, Rail Minister Theresa Villiers announced today.

Under a deal funded by the Government, passengers on Northern Rail are to benefit from an extra 22 train carriages. Separate agreements also deliver an extra six carriages to First Great Western and an additional 4 carriages to London Midland.

Theresa Villiers said:

>I am delighted we have been able to finalise these important deals which will make a real difference to passengers. Even at a time when we are tackling the huge deficit we inherited, we are determined to invest in Britain's future. That is why we're committed to a major investment programme in our railways to deliver a big increase in capacity to ease crowding and provide commuters with more comfortable journeys.

>Today's good news has been made possible by our plans to introduce 2,700 new rail carriages on to the network by May 2019. 

>We are also committed to the completion of the vital Crossrail and Thameslink projects in London and we are investing £900m in rail electrification. In the longer term our plans for a high speed rail network will free up a huge amount of space on our current network for more commuter trains - with some towns potentially seeing a near doubling of services.

>As well as improving life for passengers, these rail improvements will play an important role in strengthening economic growth.

The extra carriages, which will be in service from December 2011, are  becoming  available as a result of the planned deployment of 69 new train carriages which are being delivered to London Midland for use in the Birmingham area. This then allows for the carriages currently being used by London Midland to serve passengers using Northern Rail and First Great Western services. Consequently some First Great Western trains are to be released to serve Northern Rail passengers.

## Notes to Editors

  * These interventions in total procure the operation of 32 additional carriages for these franchises and will deliver additional seats into Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle from December 2011. 
  * They principally do so through the use of carriages that will be released from service in the London Midland (LM) franchise due to the deployment of new Class 172 DMUs. In addition, Northern are also receiving 14 additional carriages from First Great Western (FGW). 
  * The change in rolling stock for each franchise under these agreements is as follows:   
- LM will retain six Class 150 carriages (but release two x Class 153 carriages to FGW);  
- FGW will receive four Class 150 carriages (and 2 x Class 153 carriages from LM)  
- Northern will receive eight Class 150 carriages from LM and 14 x Class 142 carriages cascaded from FGW. 
  * There are eight Class 150 carriages becoming surplus in London Midland which are not covered by the agreements with these TOCs. These trains are non-standard units that may subsequently be sought by another TOC, PTE or local authority for additional services. 
  * The total cost of this investment is £16.7 million. This covers the net cost of additional passenger services until the end of each franchise. 
  * The following table shows the total planned seating and standing increases for each city each day resulting from these extra carriages and related changes. These are the combined figures for the three-hour morning and evening peak periods. 

| Birmingham* | Bristol | Leeds | Manchester | Liverpool | Sheffield | Newcastle | **Total** |
| 3,276* | 1,305 | 1,285 | 2,103 | 150 | 592 | 137 | **8,848** |

*Subject to a proposed change to the Service Level Commitment currently being consulted by London Midland being approved.

  * The figure given for Birmingham is that which would apply if a proposed change to the Service Level Commitment is approved. This change is currently being consulted on by London Midland. If the change is not approved a lower increase in capacity would apply in Birmingham.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110616b,"Rail passengers to benefit from 1,200 new carriages","Rail Minister Theresa Villiers  today announced the next stage in a plan to build around 1,200 new rail carriages.","Rail passengers are set to benefit from less crowded and more frequent trains after Rail Minister Theresa Villiers today announced the next stage in a plan to build around 1,200 new rail carriages. The carriages will be used on the busy Thameslink route, allowing existing Thameslink carriages to be redeployed to relieve over-crowded rail routes across the country.

The £6bn Thameslink upgrade - of which the new carriages are a crucial part - will almost double the peak-time capacity on Thameslink's core central London section, allow longer trains to run and provide new fast and frequent London connections to towns and cities both north and south of the capital. The trains will also be lighter, more reliable and more energy efficient. The first new carriages will arrive in 2015.

Siemens Plc and XL Trains - a consortium comprising of Siemens Project Ventures GmbH, Innisfree Ltd and 3i Infrastructure Plc - have been appointed preferred bidder to build, own, finance and maintain the new trains. Siemens is already one of the leading suppliers of trains on British railways and employs around 16,000 people in the UK. The contract will create up to 2,000 new UK jobs. This includes work being created at Siemens' factory in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, as well as in the rail industry supply chain. It also includes jobs at two maintenance depots for the new trains which, subject to planning permission, will be built at Three Bridges near Crawley and at Hornsey in the London Borough of Haringey. The Thameslink infrastructure works will employ an additional 3,000 people at the height of construction.

Theresa Villiers said:

>This is a major step forward for the long-awaited Thameslink Programme which will make life better for thousands of commuters. Today's announcement is further proof of the Government's commitment to investing in Britain's future. Despite the pressure on budgets resulting from the need to tackle the deficit, we remain fully committed to the Thameslink upgrade which will dramatically improve journeys for commuters and boost the economy.

>The announcement of Siemens Plc and XL Trains as preferred bidder for this contract represents the best value for money for taxpayers. It will create around 2,000 new jobs and will provide Thameslink passengers with modern, greener and more reliable trains.

>The new trains are a major part of the Government's commitment to introduce an additional 2,100 carriages on to the rail network by 2019. Once the new trains are delivered, current Thameslink rolling stock becomes available to improve rail services in the North West of England, the Thames Valley and other areas yet to be confirmed.

>The Thameslink Programme includes major improvements to central London stations such as Blackfriars, Farringdon and London Bridge. It will reduce crowding by almost doubling capacity on the central section of one Britain's busiest railways. Passengers will also get the benefit of a new generation of electric commuter trains operating at metro-style frequency levels during the morning and evening peaks through the central section.

## Notes to editors

  1. The DfT has selected Siemens Plc and XL Trains - a consortium comprising of Siemens Project Ventures GmbH, Innisfree Ltd and 3i Infrastructure Plc - as the preferred bidder in the competition to provide the new trains and depots for the Thameslink Programme. Siemens' UK Rolling Stock business already has more than 1,500 carriages with six mainline rail operators.
  2. The Department intends to retain the other bidder - VeloCity - a consortium comprising of Bombardier Transportation (Holdings) UK Ltd, RREEF Ltd, Serco Holdings Ltd, Amber Infrastructure Group Ltd and SMBC Leasing (UK) Ltd - as the reserve bidder in the event that contracts cannot be successfully finalised with Siemens Plc and XL Trains.
  3. Subject to finalising the contract with Siemens Plc and XL Trains, up to 2,000 new jobs will be created in the UK. This includes up to 600 associated with the manufacturer of train components and up to 650 associated with the building of the two new Thameslink depots. It also includes up to 750 workers to maintain the trains and operate the depots, including jobs in the wider associated supply chain. The new depots are proposed to be located at Hornsey in the London Borough of Haringey and Three Bridges near Crawley and are currently subject to planning application processes.
  4. The new Thameslink trains will start to operate early in 2015 alongside the existing rolling stock, with the full fleet in use from the end of 2018.  The new trains will offer a step change in passenger experience, with greater passenger carrying capacity, improved passenger communication and easy access for passengers with specific mobility needs. The new trains will also be good for the environment as they will be more energy efficient and they will be better for the tracks because they will be lighter, meaning less wear and tear and less disruption caused by maintenance.
  5. The Thameslink Programme will make travelling across London and the south east easier and quicker. It will reduce crowding on some of the busiest sections of London's transport network and introduce a new generation of carriage electric commuter trains, carrying up to 1750 passengers. On completion in 2018, up to 24 trains per hour will operate through central London, reducing the need for interchange onto London Underground services. The capital cost for the new infrastructure and the new rolling stock is estimated at around £6 billion.
  6. The first stage of the Thameslink Programme is already under construction. Building work is already well underway at Farringdon and Blackfriars stations, and platform extension work has been completed at many locations including Luton Airport Parkway and St Albans. This first stage will enable some longer 12 carriage trains to operate on the Bedford to Brighton route from December 2011. The platforms at Blackfriars station are being extended across the river to make it the first station to span the width of the Thames. Farringdon station is being significantly improved and will also provide a new interchange onto Crossrail once that scheme is completed.
  7. The second stage involves the reconstruction of London Bridge station and its approaches and a new connection to the East Coast Main Line just to the north of St Pancras. This stage will facilitate operation of up to 24 trains per hour in both directions through the central London core section, as well as longer 12 carriage operation to a range of destinations to the north and south of London from December 2018.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110511,Hammond welcomes rail value for money report,Report on reducing fares and costs on Briain's railways.,"Inflation busting rises in rail fares could become a thing of the past if the £1 billion annual cost savings in the railways envisaged in a report published today are achieved, the Government has said.

Responding to Sir Roy McNulty's independent rail value for money study, Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 welcomed the report and emphasised the need to reduce the cost of our railways. 

The recommendations of Sir Roy's highly detailed report entitled ""Realising the Potential of GB Rail"" will now be considered and will feed into Government proposals to reform the rail industry to be published later in the year. 

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said: 

>I want to thank Sir Roy for the huge amount of time he has spent preparing this in depth report on why Britain has one of the most expensive railways in the world.

>He warns that unless we get a grip and cut the costs of our railways, passengers could see services cut and fares rise. But, if we seize this opportunity, work together, and push through real reform in our railways we will be able to make savings for both taxpayers and fare payers.

>If Sir Roy's target of £1bn per year of savings is achieved, over the next few years, our aspiration should be to put the era of the above-inflation average rises in regulated fares behind us, as well as reducing levels of taxpayer subsidy. If we are going to achieve this goal we will need everyone involved in the industry, Network Rail, train companies, Unions and Government, to work together and I look forward to beginning that process.

Last year Sir Roy McNulty was commissioned to conduct an independent study into rail value for money. His December 2010 interim report set out a preliminary assessment of the costs of rail in Great Britain and an estimate of savings of up to £1bn that could be achieved without the need of cutting services.

Today's final report sets out his recommendations for improved efficiency and value for money in the rail industry. The Government will now consider which of Sir Roy's recommendations to take forward and on what timescales, and is developing a wider package of rail reform to secure a sustainable railway at lower cost that delivers a better deal both to the taxpayer and to the fare payer.

As well as welcoming Sir Roy's work, the Government has also today outlined its intentions for the future re-letting of the Intercity West Coast franchise which operates services between London and Scotland, serving Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool and North Wales. 

The new franchise will run from 2012 to 2026, to align with the proposed opening of the first phase of High Speed 2. 

The proposed Train Service Specification for Inter City West Coast represents a relaxation from the rigid timetable specification of the past, while retaining obligations that protect the key elements of service, such as principal first and last trains and minimum numbers of station stops per week and per day. This marks a significant shift from the micro-management that has prevented operators from maximising capacity and reacting to the changing demands of their passengers in the past.

A stakeholder briefing document for the Inter City West Coast franchise, detailing consultees responses, was published today along with an Invitation to Tender which has been published in draft format to allow a further consultation to take place on the train service requirement proposed.

The new franchise will start on 9 December 2012 and it will run until 31st March 2026 with an option for the Department to extend up to 20 months.

In the meantime, the Department is discussing with Virgin Rail the terms of an extension to the current franchise to 8th December 2012. If satisfactory terms cannot be agreed, DOR - the company which runs East Coast on behalf of the Government will be ready to operate the West Coast Mainline on a temporary basis.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110426,New operator sought for Greater Anglia rail services,Invitation to tender for the Greater Anglia rail services.,"The Government has set out the level of service it expects from companies bidding to run rail services in Greater Anglia, following today's publication of the [invitation to tender document](/publications/greater-anglia-franchise/) for the short 17-month franchise.

The new operator will take over from February 2012 and would be responsible for delivering services to destinations from London and across Greater Anglia - including Great Yarmouth, Kings Lynn, Southend, Ipswich and Cambridge - until at least July 2013. 

As one of the rail franchises serving Stratford and the Olympic stadium the new operator will be responsible for introducing longer and more frequent trains during the London 2012 Olympic Games.

The Government has set out the following objectives for the franchise in the invitation to tender: 

  * Delivering a quality of service for passengers for the entire rail journey. 
  * Working with the Department and other stakeholders to ensure value for money.
  * Managing and delivering changes required to accommodate Crossrail. 
  * Working effectively with Network Rail to maintain performance.
  * Delivering longer and more frequent services to support the London 2012 Olympic Games.
  * Controlling operational costs and maximising revenue.

As part of the bidding process each of the bidders will also need to set out how they intend to improve passenger satisfaction in the service they would provide. 

The Government plans to reform rail franchising and to lengthen rail franchises to around 15 years. This shorter franchise will allow time for reforms identified by Sir Roy McNulty's review of the rail industry's value for money to be properly considered and built into the terms of the subsequent Greater Anglia franchise. 

The [Greater Anglia invitation to tender](/publications/greater-anglia-franchise/)

The extra carriages will be used to run more trains at busy times - on the lines from Skipton, Ilkley and Doncaster via Wakefield into Leeds - and to lengthen other existing services operated by Northern Rail. They form part of the 650 additional carriages the Government will introduce onto the UK's rail network by 2014. 

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>Even at a time of severe pressure on public spending we cannot afford not to invest in Britain's future - and that's why we are investing more than £10m in providing these extra carriages for Yorkshire commuters. These extra trains will ease crowding and provide passengers with more comfortable journeys.

>The tough decisions the Government has taken on rail fares allow us to continue to deliver this sort of much needed improvement to the railways. We are investing in 2,100 extra carriages to increase capacity across the rail network and in the longer term we have plans for a high speed rail network which will ease overcrowding and make our railways fit for the 21st century.

The extra carriages are planned to enter service from December 2011. The Government is continuing discussions with Northern Rail on adding more carriages to the region's train services.

##  Notes to editors 

  * he extra carriages will allow a total of six additional trains per day operating on the Leeds - Skipton, Leeds - Ilkley and Leeds - Doncaster routes. In addition, three morning peak trains will be lengthened on the Leeds - Manchester Victoria and Bradford Forster Square - Leeds routes.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110324-2,Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train pilot on track,More money to develop the pilot for the Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train project.,"Passengers in South Yorkshire have moved a step closer to getting a continental-style tram-train thanks to a £150,000 Government grant to further develop the project, announced today by Transport Minister Norman Baker.

Tram-trains - which are designed to operate on both tram tracks and existing railways - could run between Sheffield and Rotherham, offering passengers faster journey times. Tram-trains are also lighter, more energy efficient and have faster acceleration and deceleration than conventional trains, making them greener and potentially cutting down on the need for maintenance works.

Today's announcement means the Government will provide funding for South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, Northern Rail and Network Rail to carry out further work on the business and project case for the pilot. It represents the next stage of plans for a South Yorkshire pilot scheme, announced in 2009.

Norman Baker said:

>Tram-trains offer passengers travelling from rural and suburban areas into city centres a viable, environmentally sound alternative to short and medium car commuting that can cut congestion and reduce overcrowding at railway stations.

>These sorts of rail fleets are already in use on the continent, but this is a first for the UK. The funding we are providing for this exciting project represents a real chance for us to test whether they can be adapted successfully for South Yorkshire and the rest of the UK.

Tram-trains could potentially run on the existing rail freight route from Rotherham before joining the Sheffield Supertram network at Meadowhall South.

The business and project case which the Government is funding will look at a range of issues such as the economic and environmental benefits and could lead to tram-trains being introduced in South Yorkshire in 2014.

This announcement about the tram-train comes on the same day the Government announced that they were allowing the Sheffield Highways Maintenance PFI project to continue to the next stage of the PFI funding approval process. 

###  Notes to editors 

  * A tram-train is designed to run on both urban light rail networks such as the Sheffield Supertram and conventional 'heavy' rail tracks.
  * Tram-trains already run successfully around the world, and particularly in Continental Europe. The concept was first introduced in recent times by the city of Karlsruhe in Germany, which was the first to link its street tramway and the main-line railway by running urban trams on both networks, creating the Stadtbahn Karlsruhe.
  * If introduced the new services would deliver three trams per hour all day between Sheffield city centre, the Lower Don Valley, Meadowhall shopping centre, Rotherham Central Station and Parkgate retail park.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110301,Green light for new trains and rail electrification ,Go-ahead for £4.5 billion Intercity express programme and £704 million plans to electrify Great Western Main Line.,"Scotland, Wales, northern and south west England are to get a fleet of new trains and more reliable rail links to London, creating thousands of jobs, boosting the economy and improving services for passengers, Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, announced today. He gave the go-ahead for the £4.5 billion Intercity express programme (IEP) and the £704 million plans to electrify the Great Western Main Line (GWML) between Cardiff, Bristol and Didcot. 

The Government announced today it has decided to resume the IEP procurement and proceed with the Agility Trains (Hitachi and John Laing) consortium's plans for replacement for the nation's fleet of ageing intercity high speed trains. This will mean 500 new carriages which will provide 11,000 more peak-time seats for passengers, every day on the GWML and ECML

Hitachi had previously announced its intention to build a new train factory in County Durham to build the new order, creating more than 500 new jobs and securing thousands of additional jobs in sub-supplier industries in north east England, giving a further boost to Britain's manufacturing industry. This factory is expected to be operational by 2013. 

The announcement to electrify the sections between Cardiff, Bristol and Didcot builds on November's announcement of electrification between London Paddington, Didcot, Newbury and Oxford, and will give Wales its very first main line electrified railway, cutting 17 minutes from Cardiff to London journeys and 22 minutes from Bristol to London journeys. Electric trains are not only quicker, but quieter, smoother and more reliable than diesels. They are also cleaner - producing no emissions at their point of use. 

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said: 

>This is good news for jobs, passengers and the economy. Our decision to buy a new fleet of trains and electrify new lines will allow rail passengers along the Great Western and East Coast corridors to benefit from massive improvements to journey times, more seats and more reliable services.

>Alongside our plans for High Speed Rail, it completes a picture of massive upgrades to our intercity rail corridors over the coming years.

>Whilst this is, of course, subject to the Government continuing to be satisfied that the proposal offers value for money as the commercial negotiations are concluded and that the final arrangements are compliant with the United Kingdom's EU obligations, I expect that the first of the new trains will be in service by 2016.

>Extending electrification westwards to Bristol and Cardiff will also bring all the benefits of electric trains - faster acceleration, greater comfort and cleaner, greener travel - to rail passengers in Wales and the south west.

>We have also established that a strong high-level case may exist for electrifying some of the Valley lines north of Cardiff. My Department will now work with the Welsh Assembly Government to develop a business case for the electrification of the Cardiff Valley lines.

The £4.5 billion programme will see the building of a combination of around 100 electric trains and bi-mode - diesel and electric - intercity trains which will run to Great Western Main Line stations including Oxford, Swindon, Reading, Cardiff, Swansea, Bath and Bristol and to East Coast Main Line stations such as Peterborough, York, Doncaster, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness. 

The train operating companies will contribute to the design and specification of the new fleet of IEP trains in greater detail than they had before. As soon as the trains become operational passengers will see improvements to reliability and comfort.

## Notes to Editors

### Benefits of electric trains over diesel 
Electrified railways are essential to getting maximum efficiency and capacity from a modern railway.

Compared to non-electrified railways, electrified railways are:  
- Faster;   
- Quieter;  
- Greener as they produce less CO2 and emit no air pollution at the trackside;  
- More reliable;  
- Lighter and cause less wear and tear on the tracks;  
- More cost-effective for carrying freight loads; and  
- Cheaper to buy, operate and maintain.

### Greener journeys 
Rail electrification is an important part of the Department's carbon strategy. Typically an electric train emits between 20% and 35% less carbon per passenger mile than a diesel train. This benefit will only improve as the electricity generation industry reduces its carbon levels. Electric trains also have zero emissions at the point of use, of particular benefit for air quality in pollution hot spots like city centres and mainline stations such as London Paddington.

### Rail investment
Today's announcement is part of a wider Government rail strategy to meet future increases in passenger demand, promote a move from other transport modes to rail and ensure Britain has the world-class infrastructure it needs. Major projects on the agenda include the £15bn Crossrail scheme, the £5.5 billion Thameslink modernisation and the new high speed rail link between London and the West Midlands and beyond. 

The Department for Transport and Network Rail will work closely with the Welsh Assembly to develop a business case for the electrification of the Cardiff Valley Lines and to ensure that plans for electrifying the Great Western Main Line are coordinated with the Assembly's own plans for rail rolling stock in the future Wales and Borders franchise.

### Minimising disruption  
Electric trains are more reliable than diesels. An electric intercity train will travel 40 per cent further than an equivalent diesel train before a technical failure and an electric commuter train will travel well over twice as far. 

Network Rail will use newly developed construction techniques which minimise the inconvenience to passengers for work on the Great Western line through utilising high-tech factory trains and extensively using overnight closures of less than eight hours. Passenger Focus will be given a key role in representing travellers' views throughout the work.

### Intercity express programme  
The Intercity express programme (IEP) has been led by the Department for Transport, with assistance from across the rail industry, since November 2005. 

It seeks to replace the distinctive Intercity 125 high speed train (HST) diesel fleet procured by British Rail during the 1970s and 1980s with a new, higher capacity, more environmentally friendly train.

The IEP is independent of High Speed 2, which was set up to explore options for a new high speed line along the Intercity West Coast corridor.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110216,Funding agreed for Woolwich Crossrail station box (amended copy),"New ""station box"" to be built on Crossrail line through Woolwich","Agreement has been reached to build a new 'station box' on the Crossrail line through Woolwich, Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, has announced today. 

The station box, which could be converted into a complete station in the future, will be privately funded by developer Berkeley Homes under an agreement with the Department for Transport, Transport for London, Crossrail Ltd and Greenwich Council.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said, 

>A Crossrail station in Woolwich would make travel to the centre of London quicker and easier and would help bring new investment to the area. I am pleased that we have secured this site for a future station and have reached an agreement to build the 'box' for the station at no extra cost to the taxpayer, bringing the benefits of a station in Woolwich a step closer.

>This is an excellent deal for the taxpayer and shows our commitment to deliver the ambitious Crossrail project while maximising value for money.

>Crossrail will mean 1.5million more people will be within a 45 minute journey of London's business centres; it will boost the economy and generate thousands of new jobs.

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said:

>Crossrail is set to bring billions of pounds of benefits to the whole of the capital and the wider UK but this agreement with Berkeley Homes will help bring massive financial advantages to this corner of southeast London. As well as supporting housing development in the area, putting a Crossrail station in Woolwich will slash journey time to the City, West End and beyond for local residents. It is just one of countless examples of why this project is so important on a local as well as a national level.

Rob Holden, Chief Executive, Crossrail said 

>I'm delighted that the legacy of Crossrail investment has been secured at Woolwich. Crossrail will transform journeys across the capital, particularly from south east London. Construction work on the new station box will get underway shortly.

Rob Perrins of Berkeley Homes said:

>This is an exciting project and Berkeley is looking forward to working in partnership with Crossrail in the delivery of a major new transport system for London and, in particular, in providing the Station Box at Woolwich.

>Berkeley has always been totally committed to having a Crossrail station within its flagship development at the Royal Arsenal and it is hoped that with the Partners signing the contracts for the Station Box today that this will now become a reality. 

>Berkeley is delighted that its financial strength has enabled it to make a substantial investment in the Royal Arsenal station having now acquired the remaining land from the LDA and secured a planning consent for another 3700 homes and a significant area of commercial space to complete the regeneration of this important part of London. 

>However, there is still much to do to raise funds to ensure the Station Box is fully fitted out as an operational station at no net cost to the public purse. I have every hope that this can be achieved.

In 2007, outline agreement was reached with Berkeley Homes under which they would build the basic box structure of a station at Woolwich and then construct their own development overhead. The final agreement now reached means this is now a firm and practical commitment ensuring the construction of the Woolwich station box at no additional cost to the taxpayer above the current cost of Crossrail. 

The new station will be beneficial for passengers using Crossrail, as well as for residents of the Woolwich area.

The station box at Woolwich would need to be fitted out before it is brought into full operational status - this will be conditional on developers and local businesses making sufficient contributions to pay for the cost of fitting out the station.

##  Notes to editors 

Background to Crossrail
  * Crossrail will run 118 km from Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west, through new twin-bore 21 km tunnels under central London to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. It will bring an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes commuting distance of London's key business districts. 
  * When Crossrail opens it will increase London's rail-based transport network capacity by 10 per cent supporting regeneration across the capital, helping to secure London's position as a world leading financial centre, and cutting journey times across the city. 
  * Crossrail will deliver substantial economic benefits for all of London and the South East. Latest economic forecasts suggest that Crossrail will add £42 billion to the economy, resulting in a £17 billion tax boost for the Treasury. Previous estimates were that Crossrail would deliver up to a £36 billion boost to the UK economy.
  * Crossrail is being delivered by Crossrail Limited (CRL). CRL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London. Crossrail is jointly sponsored by the Department for Transport and Transport for London. 

### Background to Woolwich Station

  1. Woolwich station box will be on the section of Crossrail that terminates at Abbey Wood. The Crossrail line to Abbey Wood will support regeneration in the Thames Gateway area, including the development of new housing and support for the local economy. 
  2. The Woolwich redevelopment site - Royal Arsenal - is a waterside housing and retail development near the proposed Crossrail station at Woolwich. The site covers approximately 30 hectares and is being developed by Berkeley Homes. 
  3. Development of the site has begun with 1,248 homes already built. The site includes a new heritage quarter including the Greenwich Heritage Centre and Royal Artillery Museum.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110119b,New franchises to provide better services for passengers,Major shake-up of the rail franchising system announced.,"Train operators are to be made more responsive to passenger needs while providing better value for taxpayers' money, Rail Minister, Theresa Villiers, announced today.

In a major shake-up of the rail franchising system, the Government proposes to set tough outcomes for train operators to achieve but to give them more flexibility on how best to deliver them. Franchises will be individually tailored to fit the diversity of different parts of the rail network, but binding obligations on service quality and tackling overcrowding are likely to form part of the Government's new approach on commuter franchises. Franchises will also be longer - normally for around 15 years - to incentivise bidders to invest in the railways.

These reform plans have been published today after a public consultation.

Theresa Villiers said:

>We are determined to ensure that the rail franchising process delivers better outcomes for passengers and better value for money for taxpayers. By granting longer franchises we will give the private sector a stronger incentive to invest in the improvements passengers want, such as new trains and better stations.

>Recent years have seen too much emphasis on Whitehall trying to micromanage the detail of the way train services are run. We don't believe that is the best way to improve services for passengers. We will protect the passenger by setting demanding outcomes for operators to achieve, but we will give more space to the professionals who run our railways to innovate and decide on the best way to achieve those outcomes. We believe that will ensure the rail industry is able to respond more quickly and flexibly to changing passenger concerns.

The reform will also replace the controversial cap and collar system with an alternative mechanism which will provide better incentives for operators to invest in service improvements.

Operators will get more flexibility over the services they run but the Government will continue to mandate the provision of core levels of service. The Department for Transport is also exploring options for measuring operators' performance against 'service quality' standards, based on passenger satisfaction data and 'mystery shopper' visits. More stations will be passed from Network Rail control to train operators as the customer-facing part of the rail industry with the strongest incentive to respond to passenger concerns.

Theresa Villiers has today also fired the starting gun on the competition to find a new operator for the intercity franchise on the West Coast Main Line, which expires in March 2012. A public consultation has been started on the shape of the replacement franchise, drawing on the new policy, but adapting it to match the specific characteristics of the West Coast operation. The franchise is proposed to last for at least 14 years. The end date is designed to align with the opening of the Government's proposed new high speed rail line - but with the option to extend by up to a year.

The new operator will be expected to put forward proposals for use of new 11-car Pendolino trains and will need to build on the successful programme of new services on the line - made possible by its recent £9bn upgrade - improving them further while delivering good value for money for passengers and taxpayers. The new operator will also be expected to put forward ideas for improving the passenger experience on board trains, providing better service information for passengers and investing in station facilities.

The Government will continue to refine its plans for the future of rail franchising alongside its work on Sir Roy McNulty's proposals to improve railways' value for money.

## Notes to editors

  * The Government launched an industry-wide consultation on proposals for reforming rail franchising on 22 July 2010 in the document Reforming Rail Franchising. The consultation, which closed on 18 October 2010, asked for responses to a range of proposals for reforming the rail franchising system.

Designation enables train companies to work more closely with community rail partnerships to better design services to meet local need.

Theresa Villiers said:

>We want to encourage more passengers on to trains and that's why I am delighted to be able to make this announcement which means that local communities can become even more involved in how these services run and encourage train companies to provide the services local people want.

Ian Bevan, Managing Director of Northern Rail, which runs services on the Bishop Line, said:

>The community rail partnership for the Bishop Line is already doing a great job and designation will enable it to go from strength to strength. It will also assist in identifying innovative ways of developing the line to the benefit of local people and visitors to the area.

Charlie Walton, Chairman of the Bishop Line Community Rail Partnership, said:

>I welcome community service designation as a further step towards a successful and productive partnership between the rail industry, local authorities, rail users and other interested parties which will result in an improved service encouraging more people to use the line more frequently

##  Notes to editors 

  1. The Community Rail Development Strategy looks at innovative ways of operating local branch lines, through a programme of cost management, a drive to increase passenger numbers and direct community involvement via local authorities, community rail partnerships, and other stakeholder groups. 
  2. To date, 17 lines with their services have been designated as Community Rail lines: 
    * St Ives Bay Line: St Erth to St Ives June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.
    * Abbey Line: St Albans Abbey to Watford Junction June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot projects
    * Esk Valley Line: Middlesbrough to Whitby June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot lines.
    * Tamar Valley Line: Plymouth to Gunnislake September 2005. Linked with Looe Valley as one of the six pilot projects.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101216,Reading station access improvements move a step closer ,"Department for Transport is to invest nearly £10 million towards improving access to Reading station, one of the most critical rail hubs in Britain","A £13 million scheme to improve access to an upgraded Reading Station has taken an important step forward, Local Transport Minister, Norman Baker, announced today.

The Department for Transport is prepared to invest £9.6 million towards improving access to the station - one of the most critical rail hubs in Britain.

This follows work by Reading Borough Council to reduce scheme costs - resulting in a saving of 36 per cent, or £5.4 million for the taxpayer - and increase contributions from private developers. The council will now invite tenders for the works with a view to seeking final approval from the Department in the summer of 2011.

The scheme, which includes two new multi-modal interchanges as well as highway improvements, will make it easier for road users, bus passengers, pedestrians and cyclists to access the station. The funding comes in addition to a £850 million rebuilding programme for the station - allowing significant improvements to train services, including electrification of the line between London and Oxford and Newbury.

Norman Baker MP said:

>The Government is committed to delivering major transport improvements which will help economic growth and cut carbon so I am pleased to announce that we are prepared to invest £9.6 million towards these improvements and further encourage travel by rail.

>The scheme will improve access to the station, allowing passengers to enjoy the full benefits being delivered by the wider programme of works to redevelop Reading station and the associated significant improvement in train services.

>The Department has worked closely with Reading Borough Council to encourage it to review the costs, benefits and scope of the project. Reading has met this challenge by reducing the overall cost of the scheme by £3.2 million and the Department's contribution by £5.4 million. This has set an excellent example for other local authorities to follow.

Following a further review of the scheme by the Council, the improvements include:

  * new multi-modal interchanges including direct access to the new northern and south-western station entrances;
  * safe, secure and step-free pedestrian access;
  * bus priority measures;
  * new and improved walking and cycling routes to the new interchanges;
  * significantly increased secure cycle parking provision; and
  * a new junction providing access to the new northern entrance.

##  Notes to editors 

  * Today's announcement grants the Reading station highway improvements a re-confirmed ""Conditional Approval"" following a review by Reading Borough Council of the scope, costs and benefits of the scheme. This review was undertaken in the light of the Department's statement ""Investment in Local Major Transport Schemes"" published in October 2010.
  * The next stage of the approval process for these works will be Full Approval once the Council has completed a tendering exercise.
  * The works are being led by Reading Borough Council in co-ordination with Network Rail. 
  * The project previously approved in March 2010 was a £16.4 million package of highway improvements to which the previous Government had allocated up to £15 million. Following October's Spending Review, the Department has encouraged the Council to review the scheme to reduce the Department's contribution and increase the local contribution. 
  * Reading's revised proposals are based on a package of works totalling £13.2 million. Planned improvements at the junctions of Portman Road/Oxford Road and Caversham Road/Richfield Avenue will now be deferred until a later date and will be funded from other sources. 
  * The Council has also increased the local funding contribution from £1.4 million to £3.6 million. This contribution is coming from private developers.
  * If Full Approval is granted next year, the Council expects work to start in summer 2011 and complete by autumn 2013. <
  * The project, to rebuild and enlarge the station, is led by Network Rail under a remit issued by the Department. It involves the provision of additional platforms, along with a new viaduct and underpasses to remove a number of conflicting train movements which occur at present. The design is compatible with the electrification of the Great Western Main Line between Paddington and Oxford/ Newbury. A new train care depot is also being constructed to accommodate both diesel and electric trains. The new station is designed to manage twice the present levels of business and the whole scheme is planned for completion by 2016. The total cost is £850 million. 
  * Work continues to determine the extent to which further electrification of the GWML may take place and the type of intercity express trains that will be required to replace the present High Speed diesel units. Reading station will enable additional long distance, regional and local train services to be provided, resulting from this exercise.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111207,Government targets £1bn savings from rail industry reform,Radical shake-up of railways could reduce running costs by £1bn per year and lead to better and more efficient train services.,"Rail passengers and taxpayers alike stand to benefit from a radical shake-up of the railways which could reduce running costs by up to £1bn per year and lead to better and more efficient train services, Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 announced today.

The potential savings of up to £1bn - which can be achieved without cutting services - have been identified by Sir Roy McNulty after the Government commissioned him to investigate the industry's value for money. Sir Roy finds that the key to making these savings is much closer working and alignment of incentives between train operators and Network Rail and strong leadership across the industry. Alongside its response to Sir Roy's [ interim findings](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110509101621/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/strategyfinance/valueformoney/), the Government has today confirmed plans to reform the rail franchising system to make franchises longer, more flexible and more responsive to the needs of passengers while providing better value for taxpayers.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, Transport Secretary, said:

>Incentives on the railway have become blurred and interests mis-aligned, to the detriment of efficiency, value for money and passenger satisfaction. At present Network Rail answers to its regulator, not to its customers, the train operators. Meanwhile, train operators have no interest in Network Rail's costs, since any increases or decreases are passed straight through to the Government. 

>This situation cannot be allowed to continue. All the players in the industry need to be pulling in the same direction in the interests of passengers and taxpayers. Sir Roy McNulty has pointed the way and I am establishing a high-level group, which I will chair, to drive reform. The Government is going to make significant investments in our railways in the coming years - but that support must be matched by a relentless drive for efficiency on the part of the industry.

>In parallel with work on industry reform we will also continue to develop changes to the rail franchising system to make franchises longer, more flexible, more responsive to the needs of passengers and more efficient. Taken as a whole these changes will make our railways more efficient, more accountable and better for passengers.

Sir Roy McNulty's final report - which is jointly sponsored by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) - will be delivered in April 2011. However, the Government believes that its initial findings deserve immediate action and is therefore setting up a high-level government and industry group to examine the options for getting Network Rail and train operators to work together more efficiently. The reforms could lead to route or area based alliances, aligning track and train operations where such an arrangement best serves customers. Solutions will vary across the network and there will continue to be some functions which can only be discharged by a single national body, acting as custodian of the network. Final proposals for industry reform will be published by November 2011.

Bill Emery, ORR Chief Executive, said: 

>The interim Value for Money report indicates there is scope to significantly reduce costs across the entire rail industry, over and above the cost efficiencies the regulator is driving from Network Rail.

>Sir Roy's final report will play an important role in shaping the future of Britain's railways, and in turn the independent regulation of our railways, helping to identify opportunities to improve incentives to bring down costs.

In parallel with the Sir Roy McNulty's value for money review, the Government has also been consulting with the industry on plans to reform the rail franchising system. The Government confirmed today that it will be pressing ahead with plans to make franchises longer with less detailed specifications and greater incentives for operators to act efficiently and invest in the improvements passengers want. Franchises will typically run for 15 years, so long as performance levels are maintained. Operators will get greater commercial freedom to innovate in the way they deliver and greater incentive to make investments which benefit passengers. Details of the new franchising model will now be further developed alongside plans for wider industry reform.

The West Coast Main Line franchise which operates trains between London and the West Midlands, North West and Scotland, will be the first franchise to be let under the new franchise model. The new West Coast franchise will begin in April 2012 and run until the planned opening of a new high speed rail line in 2026. This will be followed by the East Coast Main Line franchise - which operates trains between London and Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland - which will be let as a new 15 year franchise in late 2012. The Greater Anglia franchise - which operates trains between London and Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk - will also be let as a new-style longer franchise in 2013 and other franchises will be replaced with new, longer, franchises as and when they expire in future years.

##  Notes to editors 

Rail value for money report

  * [Sir Roy McNulty's interim report](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110509101621/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/strategyfinance/valueformoney/) finds that the railway is costing more than it used to and more than it ought to and that greater efficiency would realise savings of £600-£1,000m per annum by 2018/19 without cutting services. The interim report identifies the key to securing these efficiencies as a cross-industry focus on reducing costs and improving value for money in all aspects of train operation and in the operation, maintenance, renewal and enhancement of infrastructure. This, Sir Roy finds, demands much closer working and alignment of incentives between train operators and Network Rail and strong leadership across the industry. Inevitably, such alignment, if it is to be effective, will involve Network Rail working more closely at a local level with Train Operators.
  * This could lead over time to the creation of regional alliances focussed on bringing track and train together to serve customers. However, the Government believes that there are some network-wide planning and technical functions which in practice can only be discharged by a single national body, as custodian of the network and no changes should be made which would reverse the impressive improvements in safety and punctuality achieved across the industry in recent years.

Franchising

  * The Department for Transport consulted the rail industry on potential reforms to rail franchising from July to October 2010 and you can download the [consultation document](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110509101621/http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2010-28/) here
  * Details of the new franchising model will now be further developed alongside plans for wider industry reform and the Department will publish a summary of responses to the consultation in early 2011.
  * A number of rail franchises will fall due for re-tendering over the next couple of years. Typically, the Government intends to let longer franchises of at least 15 years duration and therefore believes it is important that the reforms coming from the McNulty review, the franchise consultation and the work of the high level group are incorporated into the terms of these franchises. The Government therefore proposes to use a short contract, competed in open competition in 2011, to run and improve services in the Greater Anglia franchise whilst we carry out this work until a new new-style longer franchise is let in 2013.
  * In 2012 the Government intends to award a franchise to operate Inter City West Coast until the planned opening of High Speed 2 (HS2) in 2026. Then, in late 2012, to award a franchise of 15 years to operate the East Coast Main Line services. The rest of the retendering programme for 2012 and 2013 will depend partly on decisions by the Government and existing operators on the termination dates of current franchises. The Government intends to avoid overloading the industry by inviting too many tenders at the same time. 
  * The Trans-Pennine Express franchise could contractually be extended by up to five years beyond 2012 and the Government is discussing a proposal for an extension with current operator. Alternatively, the franchise could be retendered for at least 15 years, possibly in 2013 alongside the Northern franchise. The Essex Thameside franchise will also be retendered by 2013 for at least 15 years. The Greater Western franchise will be retendered in either 2013 or 2016, again for at least 15 years, upon termination of the existing franchise agreement in accordance with its terms. 
  * It is not currently appropriate to let long-tem franchises for the Thameslink and South Eastern franchises, since both will be heavily affected by Thameslink work at London Bridge station. These will be retendered on a short-term interim basis for periods of 3 to six years as they fall due. My department will then let long-term franchises to cover the operation of Thameslink services.

Mr Hammond confirmed that London's Thameslink project will go ahead in its entirety at a total capital cost of around £6bn, as will £900m of rail electrification projects on lines between London and Didcot, Newbury and Oxford as well as between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool. In addition to the 2,100 new carriages, Britain is also to get a new fleet of intercity trains, replacing the ageing 30 year old 'Intercity 125s' on the Great Western and East Coast main lines, the Transport Secretary announced.

Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>At a time of severe pressure on public spending, it would be tempting to cut back on investment in our railways. But we cannot afford not to invest in Britain's future.

>We have already committed to the Crossrail project and to £14bn to support capital maintenance and investment in our railways over the next four years. Today I can confirm that the Thameslink project will go ahead in its entirety and I can announce 650 further carriages to reduce overcrowding. In total this amounts to 2,100 new carriages which will help make our railways fit for the 21st century.

In total the Government will deliver more than 2,100 new rail carriages onto the network by May 2019. Of these, 1,800 will be for new Crossrail and Thameslink services. This will in turn free up hundreds of existing electric carriages to be deployed onto the newly electrified lines by franchised train operators. In total, there will be at least 1,850 net additional carriages on the network by 2019. The Government will now enter into commercial negotiations with the franchised operators about the allocation of the unallocated element of 650 further carriages for delivery before 2014. Subject to those negotiations, the Government expects additional carriages to be added on services into Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham, Bristol, London Paddington and London Waterloo.

The Thameslink project will virtually double the number of north-south trains running through central London during the busiest times and provides new links between towns and cities north and south of the capital without the need to change trains in London. The programme includes the rebuilding of three major London stations, including London Bridge. The Thameslink Programme will be reprofiled, enabling Network Rail to deliver the works in a more efficient manner, improving the scheme's value for money and reducing potential risks. Passengers will, however, benefit from incremental improvements as work on the project continues to advance.

Electrification of the railway lines between London and Reading, Didcot, Newbury and Oxford, as well as between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool will allow the current diesel trains to be replaced with electric vehicles. Electric trains are cleaner, quieter and more reliable than diesels as well as providing more seats. They are also cheaper to buy, operate and maintain. The Government supports further electrification of the rail network and will continue to consider the case for further electrification schemes, including on the Midland Main Line.

Most of Britain's ageing Intercity 125 'high speed trains' are to be retired, Mr Hammond also announced. Plans to introduce a new generation of trains through the 'Intercity Express Programme' (IEP) have been under review by the Government since February. The Government has now ruled out simply refurbishing the existing trains and has also ruled out requiring passengers to interchange from electric to diesel trains at stations where electric lines end. Two alternative options remain under consideration: a revised and lower cost IEP bid from Agility Trains (Hitachi and John Laing), which envisages a mixture of electric trains and 'hybrid' trains with both electric and diesel engines; and a new proposal for a fleet of new all-electric trains which could be coupled to new diesel locomotives where the overhead electric power lines end. The Government will be in a position to make an announcement on further electrification of the Great Western Main Line once this review is complete.

##  Notes to editors 

### 2100 new carriages

  * The 2,100 new carriages includes vehicles for the Thameslink and Crossrail projects as well as extra carriages to be delivered by franchised train operators.
  * Although franchised train operators are free to introduce extra carriages at any time at their own expense, there are no contractual obligations on train operators to introduce additional carriages where there is crowding. Therefore, if the train operator does not feel it can recover the additional costs of running the extra carriages from passenger revenues they are unlikely to introduce additional carriages.
  * This is why the Government is intervening. The Government will now enter into commercial negotiations with train operators over the costs of running the additional carriages and therefore cannot publish exact numbers of carriages for each route at this time.

### Thameslink

  * The Thameslink Programme will make travelling across London and the south east easier and quicker. It will reduce crowding on some of the busiest sections of London's transport network and introduce a new generation of electric commuter trains, carrying up to 1750 passengers. 
  * The first stage of the Thameslink Programme is already under construction. Building work is already well underway at Farringdon and Blackfriars stations, and platform extension work has been completed at many locations including Luton Airport Parkway and St Albans. This first stage will enable some longer 12 carriage trains to operate on the Bedford to Brighton route from December 2011.
  * The second stage involves the reconstruction of London Bridge station and its approaches and a new connection to the East Coast Main Line just to the north of St Pancras. This stage will deliver 24 trains per hour in both directions through the central London core section, as well as longer 12 carriage operation to a range of destinations to the north and south of London from 
  * The new trains required for the Programme will require an order of around 1,200 new carriages. Two bidders, Bombardier and Siemens, remain in the competition. A preferred bidder is expected to be announced in spring 2011.
  * The capital cost for the new infrastructure and the new rolling stock is estimated to cost around £6 billion. Previously a range of £5.5bn to £6bn was given as further development of the project was required before a firmer figure could be provided. The next phase of development work for both infrastructure and rolling stock has now been completed therefore enabling a more definite view of expected cost.

### Electrification

  * On the Great Western Main Line, the Government is confirming today that the lines between London and Didcot, Oxford and Newbury will be electrified. In the North West, the routes between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool will be electrified. In more detail, that will include: 
    * Liverpool to Manchester via Newton-le-Willows
    * Huyton to Wigan
    * Preston to Blackpool
    * Manchester to Preston
  * The Great Western electrification is expected to cost up to £600 million, and the package of electrification in the North West will cost up to £300 million.
  * Electrification to Didcot, Oxford and Newbury is expected to be completed by 2016. Electrification between Manchester and the West Coast Main Line is expected to be completed by the end of 2013, allowing electric trains to run on the Manchester - Scotland route with the other lines in the North West following in sequence by 2016.

### Intercity Express Programme

  * The DfT has been considering the question of new intercity rolling stock to replace the existing Intercity 125s for some time. In February 2009 the Agility Trains consortium was identified by the Government as preferred bidder to build a new fleet of intercity trains. In February 2009 the Government invited Sir Andrew Foster, former head of the Audit Commission, to provide an independent assessment of the value for money of the programme. Sir Andrew presented his report to DfT in June 2010 recommending further study of both the Agility Trains proposal and the alternatives.
  * Following today's announcement, two options remain under consideration: 
    * Agility Trains' revised bid, for a mixed fleet of some all-electric trains, and some electric trains which are also equipped with underfloor diesel generators.
  * A proposal for a fleet of new all-electric trains which could be coupled to new diesel locomotives where the overhead electric power lines end.

Thanks to an agreement between the Government and South West Trains passengers will be able to top up their Oyster cards at all stations operated by South West Trains in the London Travelcard area from May 2011.

Transport Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>Today I am delighted to announce that all ticket machines for South West Trains in the London area network will be fitted with equipment to sell Oyster top ups, making it easier for passengers to pay.

>This is great news for all passengers travelling on the capital's rail network, especially thousands of commuters who use South West Trains before transferring to the London Underground.

Andy Pitt, Managing Director for South West Trains, added: 

>Since the launch of Oyster travel on our services earlier this year, we have been committed to finding a solution to make it possible for passengers to also top up their Oyster cards at our stations. We are pleased to have agreed a deal with the Department for Transport that will enable Oyster products to be retailed through our ticket vending machines. 

>This significant improvement will provide us with an opportunity to offer even more choice for our passengers, and will build on the Smartcard investment we've made elsewhere on the South West Trains' network.

The new equipment will be fitted to South West Trains' ticket vending machines using existing investment that South West Trains is committed to spending to upgrade stations on its network under its franchise agreement.

The Minister inspected improvement works at Lime Street Station and state-of-the-art facilities at Liverpool South Parkway Station, before unveiling public art at James Street Station.

Theresa Villiers said:

>The Government is committed to improving rail travel for passengers in North-West England - that's why we've given the go ahead for major track improvement works to reduce journey times for passengers between Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds and why we're making funding available for the electrification of the Liverpool to Manchester line.

>Improving and upgrading our railways is a key priority. That means it is vital that future investment is targeted in a way that achieves the best value for money for the taxpayer and maximises the benefits to passengers. 

>It's also why meeting with local transport leaders and viewing the facilities that are available is so important in establishing what local areas need and how central Government can help to deliver this.

The Minister met with Councillor Mark Dowd, Chair of Merseyside Integrated Transport Authority (ITA), other members of theAuthority and Neil Scales, Chief Executive and Director General, Merseytravel.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The Government recently announced that its preferred option for High Speed Rail north of Birmingham will be for two separate corridors, one direct to Manchester. A high speed line to Manchester would reduce Liverpool to Euston journey times from 2h10m to 1h36m. 
  * Merseyrail achieved a high level of performance this year with a punctuality and performance rating of 93. per cent.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100722,Shaping the future of rail franchising,Reforms to rail franchising.,"Rail franchises would be longer, more flexible and more responsive to the needs of passengers, and provide better value for taxpayers, under proposals set out today by Rail Minister, Theresa Villiers.

The proposals provide for franchises to run for 15 years as standard, so long as performance levels are maintained. In return for more private investment in the railways, operators would get greater commercial freedom to innovate in the way they deliver services. The reforms will also set tough requirements for train operators to deliver on passenger satisfaction. Operators could face being stripped of their contracts if they fail to meet those requirements.

Rail Minister, Theresa Villiers, said:

>We need to reform franchising to bring in more private sector investment in order to help deliver important improvements to the railways that passengers want. I am determined that franchises should provide the best possible value for taxpayers and deliver high quality services for passengers.

>The existing franchise system is too complicated, with too much micromanagement from Whitehall. This is not the best way to deliver value for money or protect passengers. We need a system that sets the private sector operators tough requirements on passenger outcomes and satisfaction, but gives them more scope for enterprise and innovation in working out the best way to deliver them. 

>Sir Roy McNulty's review is already studying ways of reducing the long term cost of the industry to both taxpayers and fare payers. His preliminary work will be delivered in September and will feed into our further thinking on franchise reform. We are clear that if the railways are to be made more efficient and cost effective, then early changes to the franchising system are essential.

The proposals are set out today in a public consultation which seeks views from across the rail industry, passengers and the general public on the Government's approach to rail franchising and the benefits that longer franchises and increased private sector investment in the railways would be able to offer. 

Currently the majority of rail franchises are let for around eight years but, under the proposals, future franchises will be offered on a basis of between 10 to 15 years and bidders will be given the opportunity to present the case for a longer contract which includes additional investment. Franchise specifications will also be designed to allow scope for operators to offer innovative solutions and bidders will be free to offer their own additional plans and options in their bid. 

Other proposed changes include:

- Changes to the current financial risk-sharing provisions, known as 'cap and collar', which could include a link to GDP or employment levels.
- Making it easier for operators to invest their own money during the life of the franchise, and receiving part of the value of that investment once the franchise ends.

The outcome of the consultation will be considered alongside the emerging findings of the Rail Value for Money study, chaired by Sir Roy McNulty, and the conclusions of the Spending Review.

DfT will publish its conclusions towards the end of the year and will begin re-letting franchises under a new model soon after.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100715,Minister sees Britain's new busiest station take shape,"From 2017, over 140 trains per hour will flow through Farringdon as north/south Thameslink, east/west Crossrail and London Underground.","Theresa Villiers today helped lay the foundations of London's next major transport hub in a visit to Farringdon station.

From 2017, the plan is for upwards of 140 trains per hour to flow through Farringdon as north/south Thameslink, east/west Crossrail and London Underground services all meet at the new station.

This would see Farringdon surpass Clapham Junction as Britain's busiest train station and bring passengers from outer London closer to the City and Canary Wharf.

Farringdon will be the only station from which passengers will be able to access Crossrail, Thameslink and London Underground trains. It will provide links to Gatwick, Luton, Heathrow and London City airports in addition to St Pancras International rail station.

Transport Minister, Theresa Villiers, said:

>This important work at Farringdon will see the station transformed into a 21st century transport hub, fit for the needs of a flourishing London.

>With the completion of the Crossrail and Thameslink programmes, passengers can look forward to better, faster journeys from a station set to become the busiest in Britain. Under those plans, the fully redeveloped station will act as an elegant gateway to London, Britain and the continent. And Farringdon's patient Thameslink passengers are expected to start to reap the benefits of a much-improved station from as early as Christmas next year.

The ticket hall is being constructed by Network Rail and the Minister's visit marks the start of work on the hall's foundations.

Network Rail's Thameslink Programme Director, Jim Crawford, said:

>In less than 18 months time passengers at Farringdon will benefit from this new ticket hall, vastly improving access to the station and helping transform it into one of London's most important transport hubs. 

>London relies on rail to get hundreds of thousands of people to work each day, so I'm pleased to say our work at Farringdon is on time and on budget.

Passengers using the redeveloped Farringdon station will be able to benefit from two new station entrances, a more modern, spacious national rail ticket hall, improved London Underground access and longer platforms that will be able to take 12-carriage Thameslink trains. 

It will also be fully accessible for people with pushchairs, heavy luggage or disabilities.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The new ticket hall is scheduled to open in December 2011 for Thameslink services, with work continuing unobtrusively for Crossrail services which are due to begin running from 2017.
  * Once Crossrail trains begin to operate from 2017, Farringdon will handle over 140 trains every hour - including London Underground services. This would make Farringdon busier than Clapham Junction.
  * Farringdon station is one of eight new Crossrail stations along the central tunnel section. Crossrail will run 74 miles from Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west, through new twin-bore 13 mile tunnels under central London to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. It will bring an additional 1.5 million people within 60 minutes commuting distance of London's key business districts. When Crossrail begins it's phased operations in 2017 it will increase London's rail-based transport network capacity by 10 per cent, supporting regeneration across the capital, helping to secure London's position as a world leading financial centre, and cutting journey times across the city.
  * Thameslink is one of Britain's busiest rail routes and the only overground railway to go through central London. The £5.5 - £6 billion modernisation scheme will deliver a dramatic increase in capacity, with 12-carriage trains running 24 times an hour through central London meaning more seats and improved reliability for passengers..

The Transport Secretary saw for himself visible evidence of the progress made in construction work over the last year. He was impressed at the approach to the work so far, applying innovative technology and construction techniques to drive down costs and reduce environmental impact.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>I came to visit the Crossrail project today to signal my intention to press ahead with the major improvements in our transport system that business and passengers need.  The work being carried out at Canary Wharf is an excellent example of how this can be done in an innovative and efficient way, so that we get value for taxpayers' money.   

>We live in difficult economic times, but that does not mean that we should scrap big projects which would give the economy a vital boost in the future.  But it does mean that we must ensure that every pound we invest is well spent. I am determined that this scheme remains affordable - Londoners, business and the taxpayer would expect nothing less. 

Mr Hammond met Crossrail Chairman Terry Morgan, Rob Holden, Crossrail Chief Executive, George Iacobescu, Chief Executive of Canary Wharf Group plc, Peter Anderson, Managing Director of Finance at Canary Wharf Group and Cliff Bryant, Chief Executive Director of Canary Wharf Contractors Limited, on his first official visit as Transport Secretary to a Crossrail construction site.  The majority of works on the 74 mile route are due to be completed in 2017.

##  Notes to editors 

  * On 15 May 2009 the first tubular 61ft long pile was lowered at the site of Canary Wharf Station, signalling the start of construction on the Crossrail project. Since then a further 296 tubular piles, encasing 61ft long concrete piles, and various supporting piles, ties, links and construction platforms have been installed in North Dock at Canary Wharf, forming a 4ft wide coffer dam holding back the water outside of the work site. 
  *  In February the pumps to remove approximately 98 million litres of water (over 40 Olympic swimming pools) from inside the work site at up to 800,000 litres/hour were started and now all of this water has now been successfully removed, revealing a work site that is 840ft long and 33ft below the level of the surrounding dock water. 
  * The next stages in the work include excavation of the dock bed to create a base slab to form the top of the ticket concourse, followed by top down construction of the lower slab and the Station Platform 82ft below. Canary Wharf Group plans to have the station box ready for the tunnel boring machines in summer 2012 with the station box complete and handed over in 2015. 
  * The use of Giken piling techniques to drain the dock is part of the innovative construction techniques being employed at the site by Canary Wharf Group, the first time specialist Giken machinery enabling more effective draining of the dock has been used in the UK
  * Crossrail will run 74 miles from Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west, through new twin-bore 13 mile tunnels under central London to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. It will bring an additional 1.5 million people within 60 minutes commuting distance of London's key business districts. When Crossrail begins it's phased delivery in 2017 it will increase London's rail-based transport network capacity by 10 per cent, supporting regeneration across the capital, helping to secure London's position as a world leading financial centre, and cutting journey times across the city.
  * Crossrail will deliver substantial economic benefits for all of London and the South East after the new railway opens from 2017. A study published in February 2009 assessed the key benefits including faster journey times, reduced and public transport congestions, improved productivity and higher earnings. 
  * Up to 14,000 people will be employed at the peak of construction in 2013/2015 and Crossrail will facilitate employment growth of up 30,000 jobs by 2026 in central London.
  * Crossrail services will begin from 2017, new 10-carriage trains carrying at least 1,500 passengers will travel through the 13 mile long tunnels, significantly reducing journey times between Heathrow, the West End, the City and Canary Wharf and providing new journey opportunities and much needed additional transport capacity.
  * Canary Wharf Group plc (CWG)is an integrated property development, investment and management group of companies. It is focused on the design, construction, leasing and management of Grade A office space and high quality retail and leisure facilities on its 97 acre Estate in East London.
  * Over the past 20 years CWG has regenerated derelict wharves into one of the world's premier business districts, constructing over 15 million sq ft of office and retail space - more than any other company in London.
  * Canary Wharf is home to some of the world's leading business organisations, including in the professional services; media, law, energy, financial services and transport sectors. It is also home to over 200 shops, bars, cafes and restaurants - including many of Britain's leading brands. The working population is approximately 93,000. 
  * The Estate includes 20 acres of landscaped parks and plazas. Canary Wharf hosts over 180 events a year and has one of the UK's largest collections of public art.
  * As at 30 June 2009 the Canary Wharf Group investment portfolio was 97.7 per cent let. The weighed average unexpired lease length was 16.9 years.
  * CWG was named one of the _Sunday Times _Best 60 Green Companies in the UK in 2009. 
  * Canary Wharf is set for further expansion. In 2009, CWG commenced work on the Canary Wharf Crossrail Station and has continued work on a new European Headquarters for J P Morgan. The opening by KPMG, State Street and Fitch Ratings of new office buildings on the Estate in 2009 and 2010 will also bring thousands of new workers to Canary Wharf on a daily basis.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100614,Better value for money rail inquiry asked for early initial report ,McNulty value for money review to report back early with its initial findings.,"Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, announced today that he wants an independent review of value for money in the rail industry to report back early with its initial findings.

The review by transport industry expert Sir Roy McNulty will now speed up its work so that preliminary findings are ready in time to inform Government decisions on public spending in the autumn.

The scoping study for Sir Roy's report, jointly sponsored by the Department for Transport and the Office of Rail Regulation, was published today, setting out the key issues that need to be dealt with. 

The scoping study says that the overall cost of running Britain's railway has risen but income from users has not kept pace, meaning an increased call on the taxpayer.

The way forward will involve not just cutting costs, the study says, but identifying how the industry can work more innovatively, finding new ways of doing things. The study has no ""no go areas"" and will aim to create a range of short and long-term solutions across the entire industry. Its scope has been informed by feedback from about 100 stakeholders.

The study will focus on eight broad themes: industry objectives, strategy and outputs; industry leadership, planning and decision-making; interfaces, incentives and structure; revenue; asset management; supply chain management; innovation, standards and safety; and people.

The review was launched last December and asked to report in March 2011, its remit to make recommendations to improve value for money on the railway to ensure future growth is sustainable. 

Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>""Passengers and taxpayers will rightly ask why it is that our railways in the UK are so much more expensive than those in the rest of Europe.  

>""Given the very significant financial constraints that we face, it is essential that we drive out inefficiencies and reduce costs. Better value for money is the only way we are going to protect train services and avoid very high rises in train fares. 

>""This report by Sir Roy McNulty will play a key role in informing how we go about creating an efficient and modern railway fit for the 21st century that provides taxpayers with value for money.""

In setting the context of its study, the review published today said:

-  International benchmarking carried out by ORR suggested that Network Rail is 30 to 50% less efficient in terms of maintenance and renewals expenditure than comparable European railways. 

-  The recent HS2 study found that civil engineering costs in the UK were typically up to double those in Europe.  

-  Franchising of trains in countries such as Germany and Sweden has reportedly led to cost reductions of between 20 to 40%, while train operating costs in Great Britain are still above their level in 1996-7. 

The Office of Rail Regulation's Bill Emery said:

>In recent years there has been significant growth of passenger and freight traffic on the railway, while performance has improved considerably. However, the current cost of running the railway is too high, and the burden on the taxpayer too great.

>The joint ORR and DfT Value for Money study will bring together the entire rail industry to explore ways in which we can reduce these costs so that our railway can continue to grow and prosper. The study will make recommendations about how the industry can meet the challenges of the future towards achieving our vision of a railway which delivers safety, efficiency and satisfaction levels to world class standards.

Leader of the independent review of value for money in the rail industry Sir Roy McNulty said:

>The railway as a whole faces significant challenges in terms of costs and affordability. Finding effective responses to these challenges will not be easy in such a large and complex industry.

>The study team has been encouraged by the ready co-operation we are receiving from many people within the industry, and from ORR and DfT. Our aim, with their help and support, is to chart a route to a sustainable future for rail in this country.

## Notes for editors

  * The full scoping study is available on the websites of the [Department for Transport ](http://www.dft.gov.uk/) and the [Office of Rail Regulation](http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/)
  * The former Secretary of State for Transport announced a study into the value for money of the railway on 9 December 2009, jointly sponsored by the Department and the Office of Rail Regulation. Today's scoping study is the first published output. The final report is expected by the end of March 2011.
  * The study is operating within the terms of reference announced by the Secretary of State for Transport in the Pre-Budget Report in December 2009: to examine the overall cost structure of all elements of the railway sector and to identify options for improving  value for money to passengers and the taxpayer while continuing to expand capacity as necessary and drive up passenger satisfaction. In particular, to examine:  
- what legal, operational and cultural barriers stand in the way of efficiency improvements;   
- the incentives across different parts of the rail industry to generate greater efficiency;   
- the role of new technology, processes and working practices in fostering greater efficiency;

In May this year, the then Secretary of State announced that the next InterCity West Coast franchise would start on 9th December 2012. It was further announced that the Department intended to enter into negotiations with the incumbent franchisee (West Coast Trains Ltd and Virgin Rail Group) to secure affordable and value for money operations until the start of the new franchise.

>I am pleased to announce that the Department has now agreed an extension with West Coast Trains Limited and Virgin Rail Group. This agreement will extend their current franchise on the InterCity West Coast route from 1 April 2012 until the start of the new franchise.

Over the course of the extension three new 600-seat Pendolino trains will be added to the line. This is in addition to the new Pendolino train which entered service in July of this year. Also, 31 of the existing Pendolino trains will be lengthened from 9 to 11 carriages, increasing the number of standard class seats on each train by almost 50%, from 320 to 470. In all, 106 new carriages are being introduced on the route making 28,000 extra seats available each day, an increase of 25%. This will relieve crowding on some of the busiest parts of the West Coast Main Line which is one the UK economy's most important transport corridors.

Virgin will also be responsible for providing important services enabling people travel by train to the Olympic and Paralympic Games next summer.

I can today announce that Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been awarded the Greater Anglia (Short) franchise.

The new franchise will begin operation on Sunday 5 February 2012. It will operate for 29 months (32 rail industry periods).

Bids were received from Abellio Greater Anglia Limited (NV Nederlandse Spoorwegen), Eastern Railway Limited (Go-Ahead Group PLC), and Stagecoach Anglia Trains Limited (Stagecoach Group plc).

Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has been chosen to run trains on the network, which operates across Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. The franchise will also play a significant role in transport for the London 2012 Games providing crucial services to the Olympic Park area.

The terms of the contract the Government has agreed with the winning bidder will deliver a series of improvements for passengers during the 29 month franchise.

These include providing better station and ticket facilities and measures to improve passenger information. A text messaging service to keep passengers informed if service disruption occurs will be introduced. New information desks will be provided at major stations including London Liverpool Street, Cambridge, Norwich, Ipswich and Stansted Airport.

The new franchise will make it easier for passengers to buy tickets, including:

  * extending Oyster Pay As You Go between London Liverpool Street and all stations to Shenfield, and stations to Hertford East 
  * improvements to ticket vending machines, and 
  * introducing mobile phone and print-at-home ticketing facilities.

Abellio Greater Anglia Limited has also committed to provide an additional 600 car park spaces (subject to planning approvals), more cycle storage facilities and deliver a number of other measures to improve the service to customers including deep cleaning of stations and trains.

The train company will take over station leases from Network Rail, taking on responsibility for all repairs and renewals at stations. This accords with the Government's overall franchise reform programme which advocates transfer of more responsibility for stations to train operators as the passenger-facing side of the rail industry.

To date, only overall figures for the performance of the franchise as a whole have been published. From the start of the new franchise, Abellio Greater Anglia Limited will start publishing a break down of punctuality figures by route giving passengers more transparency over the performance of the lines they use. The reliability requirements for the new franchise are also more demanding than the previous one.

When the franchise is renewed again in July 2014, the contract is expected to be 15 years in length. This forthcoming franchise will provide the opportunity to seek further improvements for passengers. We also intend to draw on the work of Sir Roy McNulty in setting the terms of the franchise with the aim of reducing costs and improving efficiency.

Since theory tests began in 1996, the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) has published the questions and answers from the question banks for all categories of tests for cars, motorcycles, lorries and buses.

However, DSA announced last November that it was to stop publishing the multiple choice questions and answers, with unpublished questions being used from January 2012.

DSA's chief executive Rosemary Thew said: ""The reason behind the move is to stop candidates from simply memorising theory test questions and answers and learning by rote. The new books contain questions and answers for revision and also explain the theory behind each question. 

>This approach to learning will help candidates to gain a better knowledge and understanding of driving theory which will help them respond correctly to the new, re-worded live questions used in the actual test.

Other theory test products including CD Roms, downloadable PDFs and ebooks have been revised too and will be published shortly after the theory test books are published on 19 September. 

The agency has also launched its first ever mobile phone apps for theory test revision, which have been developed to help candidates learn in this way.",9/19/2011,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,making-roads-safer,Driving Standards Agency,,

The new centre at Irvine's Riverside Business Park will replace the nearby practical test centres in Kilmarnock and Saltcoats, which are closing on 27 October. The new premises will offer better facilities for candidates, including a more comfortable waiting area and easier access to parking.

DSA's chief executive, Rosemary Thew, said:

>The new test centre in Irvine will provide more modern facilities and a much better environment for candidates. 

>It's normal to be nervous before taking a driving test, but we hope that having a more pleasant and comfortable test centre will help to make it a less stressful experience for candidates in Ayrshire.

Funding has been allocated to local highway authorities and schools across the country for the national Bikeability scheme which provides cycling proficiency for the 21st century.

As well as the £11m of grants agreed for this year, a further £24m will be allocated by the Department for Transport over the following two years. This includes an extra £2m to support expansion of the scheme on top of money originally earmarked for Bikeability. Additional local contributions worth around £11.5m are expected over the next three years.

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>Cycling brings many benefits, and as a government we are keen to encourage its uptake as a healthy and sustainable transport choice, which eases congestion and helps cut carbon.
 
>It is vital that the next generation of cyclists is well prepared with the skills and confidence to ride safely and well on modern roads and this funding ensures that many more thousands of children will receive the solid grounding to set them up as lifelong cyclists.

Big winners this year include Merseytravel who are receiving over £400,000, Hampshire, where children will benefit from almost £500,000 worth of training, Staffordshire receiving more than £350,000 and Kent, where total funding is over £380,000.

The Department has also published a report looking at the number of children cycling to school since the introduction of the Bikeability scheme five years ago. In March the scheme celebrated five years of delivering training for children in schools.

This report shows that where there is a longer history of delivering cycle training, a higher proportion of children are cycling to secondary school. Further, those authorities that have received higher levels of Bikeability funding have seen larger increases in cycling to secondary school.

## Notes to Editors

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120404a,New safety helmet ratings published ahead of Easter Bank Holiday,14 extra motorcycle helmet ratings from SHARP have been published today.,"An extra 14 motorcycle helmet ratings from the Department for Transport's Safety Helmet Assessment and Rating Programme (SHARP) have been published today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning ahead of the Easter bank holiday weekend.

Today's ratings take the total number of helmets rated by SHARP - the Safety Helmet Assessment and Ratings Programme - to 261.

Mike Penning said:

>Many of us will be getting our bikes out and - with luck - take advantage of some sunshine over the bank holiday weekend.

>I would urge anyone thinking about buying a new helmet ahead of the start of the summer season to check out the SHARP website before making their decision. A properly fitted helmet with a high SHARP rating will provide you with the best possible protection in the event of an accident so it's well worth checking the advice on the site before you buy.

All helmets must meet minimum legal safety standards to be sold in the UK but the SHARP scheme uses a wider range of tests to provide riders with more information on how much protection a helmet can provide in a crash. The objective advice, which includes important guidance on how to select a good-fitting helmet, will help riders to choose the safest helmet suitable for them.

The SHARP tests - which award ratings of between one and five stars - show that the safety performance of helmets can vary by as much as 70%. With helmets across a wide price range scoring highly all riders should be able to find a high performing helmet in a size and style that fits them and at a price they want to pay.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dsa-press-20120402,Safety improvements for motorcyclists and lorry and bus drivers,Measures to boost safety for motorcyclists and lorry and bus drivers have been put forward in Parliament.,"Measures to boost safety for motorcyclists and lorry and bus drivers have been put forward in Parliament. 

The measures - which also strengthen requirements for driving examiners and impact on the rules for drivers towing trailers - will come in to force on 19 January 2013 as part of new European requirements aimed at improving road safety. 

The changes are being implemented by the Department for Transport in conjunction with the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). 

The main aspects of the new rules are:

  * **Motorcyclists** - Access to more powerful bikes will be staged subject to competence, age and previous experience. The minimum age to ride the largest bikes without previous experience will rise from 21 to 24.
  * **Licence renewals for bus and lorry drivers** - At present, drivers of medium-sized and large buses and lorries need to renew their licences every five years once they reach the age of 45. Over 45s also need to demonstrate their fitness to drive through a full medical report. From 2013, all new or renewed bus and lorry licences will be renewable every five years. However, drivers under 45 will not require a full medical report and will still only need to renew their photograph every 10 years. All other drivers and riders will continue to renew their driving licences every 10 years as is currently the case.
  * **Driving examiners** - Compulsory initial qualification, periodic training and quality assurance checks will be required for driving examiners. Britain already fulfils most of these requirements but the new rules will enhance the Driving Standards Agency's existing arrangements.
  * **Trailer towing** - Under the new rules car drivers will be limited to towing 3.5 tonnes.

DSA chief executive, Rosemary Thew, said:

>Britain already has some of the safest roads in the world. These changes build on our existing standards and recognise the importance of our examiners' professionalism. They will also help to ensure that new motorcyclists gain the right skills and experience before riding bigger bikes.

DVLA chief executive, Simon Tse, said: 

>These changes will provide a useful additional reminder for bus and lorry drivers. They will help to ensure that drivers of these vehicles will continue to operate to high levels of levels of safety by ensuring that they are fit to drive.

The European requirements are being introduced in Great Britain in line with feedback from a public consultation, which included responses from driver and rider training bodies, trade associations and road safety groups.

A £1.2 million THINK! campaign urging drivers to see the person behind the motorcycle helmet was launched today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.

The TV adverts will show bikers with flashing neon signs attached to their bikes. The signs show the rider's name and information about them such as 'shy retiring type' or 'new dad'. The voiceover at the end asks drivers to look out for motorcyclists next time they are out driving.

The campaign was informed by research showing that drivers are more likely to notice motorcyclists on the roads if they know a biker themselves.

The adverts put motorcyclists at the centre of the campaign in a bid to tackle the huge over-representation of motorcyclists in road casualty figures. Despite only accounting for 1% of traffic motorcyclists make up 22% of deaths on Britain's roads.

Mike Penning said:

>As a biker myself I know how great motorcycling can be but as Road Safety Minister I know that the statistics show bikers are tragically over-represented in road casualties and I want to see this number come down.

>The campaign I am launching today aims to get drivers to think again about how they look at bikers when they're out on the road.  I hope this will help to reduce the number of bikers killed and injured in crashes with cars.

The new 'Named Riders' TV campaign starts on Friday 2nd March with radio and petrol station advertising running from Saturday 10th March. 

## Notes to Editors

TV advertising will run from 2nd to 24th March.  Radio and petrol station advertising will run from 10th to 31st March.

The THINK! Named Rider campaign costs £1.2 million.  It is estimated that the campaign will reach 92% of drivers an average of eight times. 

In 2010, 5,183 motorcyclists were killed or seriously injured with 74% of these occurring in accidents involving another vehicle.  66% of these casualties happened at junctions.

Until now all the questions used in the driving theory test have been published. These changes will mean that learner drivers and riders gain a better understanding of driving theory, because they can no longer rely on simply learning which options are correct for individual questions.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>By bringing a stop to publication of theory test questions we aim to encourage candidates to prepare by learning each topic area thoroughly rather than just memorising the questions and answers.

>The intention is to improve candidates' knowledge and understanding of driving theory, so that they are more able to retain and apply it when they are on the road.

The familiar theory test books and software still offer revision questions for candidates to test themselves and assess their progress. They now also have exercises so learners can practice applying their knowledge on each topic to case studies. There are also new sections of revision support for motorcyclists and a free e-book for car drivers.

The agency has also launched its first iPhone apps for theory test revision, which also help candidates to study and monitor their progress at their convenience as they approach their test date. These are available from the iTunes Store.

These aim to improve both the standard of courses offered to drink-driving offenders and the way they are approved. The proposals are also intended to encourage more training providers to become involved in delivering DDRS courses, improving access to the scheme for offenders in areas with high incidences of drink-driving.

The government also intends to make the financing of the scheme fairer. Rather than the cost of administering the scheme being met by the general taxpayer, the consultation proposes that offenders should pick up the bill for this through the fees they pay to cover the cost of their training. 

The overall aim is to reduce the number of re-offenders by educating them on the potential consequences of their behaviour.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>Most drivers are safe and responsible but there is a reckless minority who put lives in danger by drink driving and those drivers need to be tackled effectively.

>As well as taking action to help the police to deal with drink-drivers, we are looking at how we can reduce the likelihood of re-offending through improving the Drink-Drive Rehabilitation Scheme.

>Improving the way courses are delivered is a positive step towards achieving this and will help to ensure Britain's roads remain among the safest in the world.

The government's Strategic Framework for Road Safety sets out a commitment to improve the enforcement of drink driving legislation by making DDRS courses mandatory for disqualified drink-drivers. The measures proposed in the consultation are the first step in that process.

The £700,000 campaign, which will run on television and in cinemas, is aimed at children aged six-11 and spells out the dangers of not taking care on the roads. Television adverts will highlight the importance of finding a safe place to cross the road while the cinema campaign will remind children of the importance of making sure they can be seen when they are out after dark.

In 2010 more than 19,500 children were injured on the roads and 55 were killed.

Mike Penning said:

>Britain's roads are among the safest in the world and the number of children killed or seriously injured is 72 per cent lower today than twenty years ago. However, every death on the roads is a tragedy and we are determined to reduce these numbers further.

>That is why - despite the need to cut the deficit - we are continuing to invest in child road safety campaigns to help children to understand the importance of crossing the road safely.

>The television and cinema advertising campaign we are launching today will help to give children the skills and knowledge they need to stay safe as they grow more independent.

Advertising in cinemas began today and television advertising will begin on Monday 17th October.

Careless driving will be made a fixed penalty offence to allow the police more effectively to tackle reckless driving that puts other road users in danger, while disqualified drivers face having to take a new test before regaining their licence.

There will also be more educational courses that can be offered in place of a fixed penalty and points in appropriate cases as well as a new post-test qualification for novice drivers, under plans set out in the new Strategic Framework for Road Safety.

And as new analysis shows, 3,500 deaths and serious injuries could have been prevented in a year if the successes of better local authorities and police forces had been matched across the country. Local people will be given the information they need to have a real say in road safety priorities on their local roads.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>This report marks a sea change in how we tackle road safety in this country. We are determined to differentiate between wilfully reckless drivers and the law abiding majority who sometimes make honest mistakes, or who have allowed their skills to deteriorate. 

>We will focus relentlessly on cracking down on the really reckless few who are responsible for a disproportionately large number of accidents and deaths on our roads. By allowing the police to focus resources on dealing with these drivers, we can make our roads even safer.

>Our vision is to ensure Britain remains a world leader on road safety. We will only do this is if we bring people with us. This means cracking down on the most dangerous drivers without waging war on the law abiding majority. 

The new Strategic Framework for Road Safety sets out the Government's plans to:

  * Make careless driving a fixed penalty offence to allow the police more effectively to tackle the wilfully reckless driving that puts other road users in danger. Guidance will ensure that that the circumstances in which a fixed penalty notice is appropriate are clearly defined.
  * Require offenders to pass a test before they regain their licence after a serious disqualification.
  * Make greater use of powers to seize vehicles to keep the most dangerous drivers off the roads.
  * Increase the level of fixed penalty notices for traffic offences from £60 to between £80 and £100 and penalty points. Levels have fallen behind those for other fixed penalty offences, which risks trivialising the offences.
  * Improve enforcement against drink and drug driving, as announced in the response to the North Report in March.
  * Increase the use of police-approved educational courses that can be offered in place of fixed penalty notices to encourage safer driving behaviour. 
  * Launch a new post-test qualification for new drivers, including an assessment process to give insurers confidence that it will create safer drivers who can expect to pay lower insurance costs. This will replace the current Pass Plus scheme.
  * Continue to improve the driving and motorcycling training processes, including introducing film clips into theory test.
  * Create a new website to allow local people to easily compare the road safety performance of their local area against similar areas, as well as a new portal to help road safety professionals share information. The framework published today also includes maps which show the recent road safety records and improvements of local authorities.
  * Launch an annual road safety day.

The framework also sets out the roles and responsibilities of local authorities, road safety professionals and other stakeholders in improving road safety and the increased freedom that is being given to local authorities in assessing and acting on their own priorities.

The Government's long term vision is to ensure that Britain remains a world leader on road safety and the Department will monitor its performance against indicators in a new road safety outcomes framework.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The Strategic Framework for Road Safety
  * The Government's response to the North Report, covering what steps will be taken to tackle drink and drug driving
  * Maps showing the road safety performance of individual local authorities are included on p27-28 of the Strategic Framework. These are based on figures published in Reported Road Casualties Great Britain. And here is the detailed local authority data
  * New analysis of these figures, included in the strategy, shows that if lower-performing local authorities were to increase their road safety performance so that their killed or serious injured (KSI) casualty rate per billion vehicle miles for 2007-09 was no higher than for the median (mid point) local authority, we might have expected the number of KSIs to be 14 per cent lower than observed - or around 3,500 fewer KSI casualties per year.
  * The Department for Transport has also today published summaries of the responses to two consultations: the Road Safety Compliance Consultation and A Safer Way
  * The UN has proclaimed 2011-2020 as the Decade of Action for Road Safety with a goal of stabilising and then reducing global road deaths. The launch of the road safety framework has been scheduled to coincide with the launch of this decade of action. The UK is a world leader in road safety and the framework demonstrates our commitment to contribute to the further reduction in road deaths envisaged globally by the UN.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110420,New SHARP ratings announced ahead of bumper bank holiday ,Motor-cyclists urged to buy helmets with high SHARP ratings.,"More than 20 new motorcycle helmet safety ratings were published today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning ahead of the extended bank holiday. 

Today's ratings take the total number of helmets rated by SHARP - the Safety Helmet Assessment and Ratings Programme - to 247. 

Mike Penning said:

>Many of us will be making the most of the extended bank holiday period to take our bikes out and - hopefully - take advantage of some good weather.

>I would urge anyone thinking about buying a new helmet ahead of the weekend to check out the SHARP website before making their decision. A well-fitted helmet with a high SHARP rating will provide you with the best possible protection in the event of an accident so it's well worth checking the advice on the site before you buy.

All helmets must meet minimum legal safety standards but the SHARP scheme uses a wider range of tests to provide riders with more information on how much protection a helmet can provide in a crash. The objective advice, which includes important guidance on how to select a good-fitting helmet, will help riders to choose the safest helmet suitable for them. 

The SHARP tests - which award ratings of between one and five stars - show that the safety performance of helmets can vary by as much as 70%. With helmets across a wide price range scoring highly all riders should be able to find a high performing helmet in a size and style that fits them and at a price they want to pay.

The [SHARP website](http://www.direct.gov.uk/sharp) was re-developed in response to feedback from motorcyclists and the motorcycle industry and has increased in popularity since it was re-launched last summer.  

##  Notes to editors 

  * The [new SHARP ratings](http://sharp.direct.gov.uk/news/launch-28-new-helmet-ratings) published today 
  * Motorcyclists represent approximately oneper cent of UK traffic yet account for 21 per cent of our casualty base; 472 motorcyclists died on UK roads in 2009. Accident studies show that approximately 80 per cent of motorcyclists killed and 70 per centof those with serious injuries sustain head injuries.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-201104l,Uninsured driving crackdown moves step closer ,Action can now be taken against those who ignore warnings to get their vehicle insured.,"A new system to tackle uninsured driving moved a step closer today as Road Safety Minister, Mike Penning, laid the final regulations in Parliament.

Under Continuous Insurance Enforcement it will be an offence to keep an uninsured vehicle, rather than just to drive when uninsured.

The regulations laid today will allow the DVLA to take action against those who ignore warnings to get their vehicle insured.

Mike Penning said: 

>Uninsured drivers injure 23,000 people each year and add £30 to every responsible motorist's premium so we need to do everything we can to keep them off the roads.

>These new powers will help us to take targeted action while freeing up police time to deal with the hard core of offenders.""

Under the new system:

  * The DVLA will work in partnership with the Motor Insurers' Bureau to identify uninsured vehicles.
  * Motorists will receive a letter telling them that their vehicle appears to be uninsured and warning them that they will be fined unless they take action.
  * If the keeper fails to insure the vehicle they will be given a £100 fine.
  * If the vehicle remains uninsured - regardless of whether the fine is paid - it could then be clamped, seized and destroyed. The regulations laid in Parliament today would give the DVLA the powers to take this action.
  * The vehicle will only be released when the keeper provides evidence that the registered keeper is no longer committing an offence of having no insurance and the person proposing to drive the vehicle away is insured to do so. 

Vehicles with a valid Statutory Off Road Notice (SORN) will not be required to be insured.

It is planned for the first insurance advisory letters (which warn individuals that they appear to be uninsured) to be sent at the end of June following a publicity campaign to raise awareness of the CIE scheme.

The Motor Insurance Database (MID) will be used to identify registered keepers of vehicles that appear to have no insurance. All drivers can check their vehicle is recorded on the [MID for free](http://www.askmid.com/).

##  Notes to editors 

  * Latest estimates are that around 4 per cent (around 1.4 million) of GB motorists drive uninsured. The penalty for driving without insurance is a maximum fine of £5,000 and six - eight penalty points. Around 242,000 offenders are convicted for uninsured driving every year.
  * Currently every responsible motorist pays an average £30 each year within their premiums to cover crashes involving uninsured and untraced drivers. It is also estimated that uninsured and untraced drivers kill 160 people and injure 23,000 every year.
  * Measures already introduced in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 gave police improved access to the Motor Insurers' Bureau database and powers to seize vehicles. In 2009 around 180,000 vehicles were seized.
  * The Road Safety Act 2006 provided the primary powers for a new offence of being the keeper of a vehicle which does not meet insurance requirements. The offence of keeping a vehicle with no insurance came into force on 4 February 2011 commenced by the Road Safety Act 2006 (Commencement No 6) Order 2011. 
  * Supporting regulations which provided for exceptions to the offence came into force at the same time in the Motor Vehicles (Insurance Requirements) Regulations 2011). This instrument makes exceptions to that offence, provides that liability to conviction for the offence may be discharged by paying a fixed penalty of £100 and provides for the disclosure of information in connection with enforcement. 
  * The Motor Vehicles (Insurance Requirements) (Immobilisation, Removal and Disposal) Regulations 2011 will allow persons authorised by the Secretary of State for Transport to fix an immobilisation devise (clamp) to vehicles where it is believed that an offence has been committed, and to remove and dispose of vehicles in relation to the offence of keeping a vehicle with no insurance. It also prescribes the release fee (£100) before the vehicle is released and the evidence individuals have to demonstrate in order to secure the release of the vehicle. 
  * The Road Safety Act 2006 (Commencement No.7) Order 2011 is also made which will provide the mode of prosecution and specify the penalties for the new offences of interfering with or removing an immobilisation notice or device (clamp), and falsely displaying a disabled persons badge with the purpose of avoiding enforcement action.

The first edition was published on 14 April 1931 in a bid to cut down on the number of accidents taking place on Britain's roads. Despite the fact there were just 2.3 million motor vehicles at the time, over 7,000 people were killed in road accidents that year.

The Highway Code quickly became the 'must read' publication for those using the road and is now recognised the world over. The Code is now used by millions of drivers, motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians every year and has even been featured in TV drama storylines.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>The Highway Code is the official guide to using the roads safely and responsibly. The Code has helped to save thousands of lives over the last 80 years, which is cause for celebration.

>The Highway Code is not just for new drivers, it holds crucial information for everyone from experienced motorists and motorcyclists to horse riders and pedestrians.

>The publication offers the latest information on the rules of the roads and road safety advice, as well as promoting greater courtesy and understanding among all road users. Its long-standing success is one of the reasons why Britain's roads are among the safest in the world.

The Highway Code has moved with the times and is now available in a variety of formats, including online from the Directgov website, as a download and on CD ROM with a voice-over for people with reading difficulties.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110321,Government crackdown on drink and drug driving ,Improved testing equipment to detect drink and drug drivers to get the go-ahead and key changes to streamline enforcement. ,"A package of measures to tackle drink and drug driving was announced today by Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31.

Improved testing equipment to detect drink and drug drivers will be given the green light and key changes made to streamline enforcement of both offences.

The Government will also examine the case for a new specific drug driving offence - alongside the existing one - which would remove the need for the police to prove impairment on a case-by-case basis where a specified drug has been detected.

The measures are set out in the Government's response to the North Report on Drink and Drug Driving, which was published last year.

The prescribed alcohol limit for driving will not be changed, with the focus instead on improving enforcement and education to tackle the drink and drug drivers who put lives at risk. 

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>Drink and drug driving are serious offences and we are determined to ensure they are detected and punished effectively. 

>It is just as dangerous to drive impaired by drugs as alcohol so we need to send a clear message that drug drivers are as likely to be caught as drink drivers and that drug driving is as socially unacceptable as drink driving has become. That is why we will approve drug-testing devices and change the law to speed up the testing process, ensuring the police can bring drug drivers to justice.

>The number of drink driving deaths has fallen by more than 75% since 1979. But drink driving still kills hundreds of people so we need to take tough action against the small minority of drivers who flagrantly ignore the limit. Their behaviour is entrenched and after careful consideration we have concluded that improving enforcement is likely to have more impact on these dangerous people than lowering the limit.

>We are therefore taking forward a package of measures which will streamline enforcement, helping the police to target these most dangerous offenders and protect law-abiding road users.

On drink driving the Government will:

  * revoke the right for people whose evidential breath test result is less than 40% over the limit to opt for a blood test (the 'statutory option'). The breath testing equipment used in police stations is now very accurate and technically sophisticated so a blood sample is not needed to confirm the breath test. The need to organise a blood sample can mean that drivers who were over the limit when breath tested have fallen below the limit by the time their blood sample is taken - removing the statutory option will eliminate this loophole.
  * introduce a more robust drink drive rehabilitation scheme, so that we can require those drink drivers who are substantially in excess of the limit to take remedial training and a linked driving assessment before recovering their licence.
  * approve portable evidential breath testing equipment for the police - this will speed up the testing process and free up police time.
  * close a loophole used by high risk offenders to delay their medical examinations.
  * streamline the procedure for testing drink drivers in hospital.

On drug driving the Government will:

  * approve preliminary drug-testing equipment - initially for use in police stations, and at the roadside as soon as possible. The Home Office is currently testing six drug-testing devices and hopes to be able to take decisions on type-approval by the end of June. 
  * allow custody nurses to advise the police whether or not a suspected driver has a condition that may be due to a drug. This will remove the need to call out police doctors and so speed up the testing process - ensuring that drug drivers do not escape punishment because a doctor is not available and also freeing up police time.
  * examine the case for a new specific drug driving offence - alongside the existing one - which would remove the need for the police to prove impairment on a case-by-case basis where a specified drug has been detected.

##  Notes to editors 

### Drink driving - the figures

Deaths from drink driving have fallen 77 per cent since 1979:

  * 1979 - 1,640
  * 2009 - 380 (provisional figure)

Latest coroners' data (2008) shows that of drivers and riders killed in road accidents:

  * around a fifth (18 per cent) were over the drink drive limit.
  * 12 per cent - two-thirds of all those who were over the limit - had more than twice the legal amount of blood alcohol in their body. 7 per centof those killed - 40 per cent of those who were over the limit - were at least 2.5 times over the limit.
  * 82 per cent were below the prescribed limit (80mg per 100ml of blood).
  * 2 per cent were between 51 and 80mg/100ml.

81,000 people were convicted in England and Wales in 2008.

### Drug driving - the figures

We do not have the level of information available about drug drivers that we have for drink drivers as they cannot be so easily tested.

Sir Peter North quotes figures which show a six-fold increase in the incidence of illicit drugs in samples taken from victims of fatal road accidents between 1989 and 2000. 

In 2009 impairment by drugs (illicit and medicinal) was recorded as a factor in 46 fatal accidents (2 per cent of total) and 169 serious accidents (1 per cent of total). However, we believe that this is under-reported because of the difficulty of testing drug drivers and so believe that the real figure is likely to be higher.

### Drink and drug driving - the law

It is an offence to drive when over the drink drive limit. The breath alcohol limit is 35 microgrammes per 100 millitres of breath and the blood alcohol limit is 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood. 

It is illegal to drive while unfit through drugs. The penalties are the same for drink driving and drug driving

On conviction, a minimum 12 month disqualification and a maximum fine of £5,000. 

The record of disqualification remains on a licence for 11 years which can mean problems for those who drive for a living. 

Such convictions can mean difficulties in renting cars or getting visas for some countries.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110111,Uninsured drivers face new crackdown ,"Under new powers it will be an offence to keep an uninsured vehicle, rather than just to drive when uninsured.","New powers to tackle uninsured driving will come into force within months, Road Safety Minister, Mike Penning, announced today.

Under the new powers it will be an offence to keep an uninsured vehicle, rather than just to drive when uninsured.

Currently, every responsible motorist pays an average £30 each year within their premiums to cover crashes involving uninsured and untraced drivers. It is also estimated that uninsured and untraced drivers kill 160 people and injure 23,000 every year.

Mike Penning said: 

>Uninsured drivers push up premiums for other motorists and often drive with no regard for other road users, so it is vital that we do everything we can to keep them off the roads.

>More than 400 uninsured vehicles are already being seized by the police every day but it is simply not possible to catch every uninsured driver in this way. That is why we are bringing in these new powers which will help us to take targeted action while freeing up police time to deal with the hard core of offenders.

Ashton West, Chief Executive at the Motor Insurers' Bureau, said: 

>Today's news marks a significant step forward in the fight against uninsured driving. This means that as enforcement can take place for both keeping and driving a vehicle without insurance there will be no place for illegal motorists to hide.

>Continuous Insurance Enforcement (CIE) will complement and run alongside existing police roadside enforcement, which has already reduced uninsured driving by 20%.

Under the new system:

  * The DVLA will work in partnership with the Motor Insurers' Bureau to identify uninsured vehicles
  * Motorists will receive a letter telling them that their vehicle appears to be uninsured and warning them that they will be fined unless they take action 
  * If the keeper fails to insure the vehicle they will be given a £100 fine
  * If the vehicle remains uninsured - regardless of whether the fine is paid - it could then be seized and destroyed.

Vehicles with a valid Statutory Off Road Notice (SORN) will not be required to be insured.

The Department for Transport today made the Commencement Order to make it an offence to be the registered keeper of a vehicle which does not have insurance, as well as regulations to support this. Further regulations will be made shortly, allowing the scheme to come into force in the Spring.

##  Notes to editors 

  * Latest estimates are that around 4 per cent (around 1.4 million) of GB motorists drive uninsured. The penalty for driving without insurance is a maximum fine of £5,000 and 6-8 penalty points. Around 242,000 offenders are convicted for uninsured driving every year.
  * Measures already introduced in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 gave police improved access to the Motor Insurers' Bureau database and powers to seize vehicles. In 2009 around 180,000 vehicles were seized.
  * The Road Safety Act 2006 provided the primary powers for a new offence of being the keeper of a vehicle which does not meet insurance requirements. Further secondary legislation is now being made to bring these provisions into force.
  * The Motor Vehicles (Insurance Requirements) Regulations 2010 make provision for regulations in support of the offence of being the registered keeper of a vehicle which does not have insurance cover. This instrument makes exceptions to that offence, provides that liability to conviction for the offence may be discharged by paying a fixed penalty of £100 and provides for the disclosure of information in connection with enforcement.

By April 2011 the Government wants information about cameras to be easily available to the public.

This could include data about accident rates at camera sites, vehicle speeds and the numbers of motorists prosecuted or offered training after offences recorded by cameras. 

Mike Penning said:

>Public bodies should be accountable and if taxpayers' money is being spent on speed cameras then it is right that information about their effectiveness is available to the public.

>The proposals I have announced today will help show what impact cameras are having on accident and casualty rates and also how the police are dealing with offenders. 

>This is in line with our commitment to improve transparency of government data so that the public are able to make more informed judgements about the work of local and central government.

The Department will be working with police and local authority representatives as well as the Highways Agency to discuss the details of what should be published and how. The final requirements will then be confirmed in time for publication in April 2011.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The Department for Communities and Local Government is consulting on a new [single government data list](http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/decentralisation/tacklingburdens/databurdens/). This includes the proposal for speed camera inventories to be made public by local authorities to support public accountability.
  * A working group involving the police, local authority officers, DfT and the Highways Agency will progress the implementation details during the next three months.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101220b,Motorcycle testing set for overhaul,New on-road test proposed for motor cyclists.,"Plans to trial a new, single, on-road motorcycle test were published today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.

The report from the motorcycle test review is the result of work the Department has undertaken with motorcycle groups, training organisations and others since June 2010. 

Mike Penning said:

>I want to make sure that we have a test which prepares bikers properly for the road so the motorcycle test review is a top priority for me.

>My goal has always been a single, on-road test which is rigorous and reflects real-life conditions. By working with the motorcycle training industry and others we have identified a set of changes which have the potential to deliver this. 

>It is also my aim that these changes will open up the test to those living in areas which are poorly served by the current network of-off road test centres. 

>I am grateful to all those who have given their time and expertise to the review and the focus will now be on starting trials of these proposals.

The test is currently carried out in two parts, one on-road and one off-road. 

The report suggests a new hazard avoidance manoeuvre which - subject to further trialling - could be carried out on the road. There is also a proposal which will be given further consideration, that slow manoeuvres such as slalom, figure of eight, and U turn could be examined at training centres by delegated examiners ahead of the main test.

The next step will be to hold wider trials, with test-level candidates, in the new year. This process will be followed by public consultation on the proposed changes. 

The Department for Transport hopes, subject to further work on safety, cost and value for money, that there would be a phased introduction of on-road testing moving to general adoption of the new test by the end of 2011 or early 2012. This will include on-road testing in priority areas which are poorly served by the current network of off road test centres. 

##  Notes to editors 

  1. The motorcycle test review started in June 2010. 
  2. The current motorcycle test was introduced in April 2009 and is taken in two parts.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101207b,New road safety evaluation website launched ,"New website helps road safety practitioners define exactly what they are doing and why, allows them to design and carry out their evaluation.","A free website to help road safety practitioners evaluate their education, training and publicity activities was launched today by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and the Department for Transport.

At the heart of the [Road Safety Evaluation website](http://www.roadsafetyevaluation.com/) is E-valu-it - an interactive tool that helps practitioners define exactly what they are doing and why, allows them to design and carry out their evaluation, and promotes the publication and sharing of results. 

The site also includes background information and guidance about evaluation.

It was developed after it was found that while evaluation of road safety engineering was already an established discipline, road safety practitioners faced difficulties in evaluating their education, training and publicity (ETP) activities. 

Road Safety Minister, Mike Penning, said:

>In the current economic climate everyone wants to make sure they are spending taxpayers' money in the most effective way. To do that it is vital organisations can accurately evaluate all activities - whether they are road engineering measures or education campaigns.

>This new website will allow local authorities to assess the value of education, training and publicity activities, which will in turn help them to design high quality schemes and target them where they will have the most impact. I am delighted that we have been able to work with RoSPA to develop this invaluable tool and I hope it will be widely used by local road safety practitioners.

Kevin Clinton, RoSPA's head of road safety, said: 

>It is recognised that it is much harder to evaluate road safety ETP than road safety engineering. But it is more important than ever that we are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of what we do. 

>The sharing of such information is also important - road safety practitioners have much to learn from each other about interventions that have worked and also those that have been less successful.

E-valu-it helps practitioners plan, carry out and report the results of ETP evaluations. The system produces bespoke recommendations for the type of evaluation that could be conducted based on the answers given to a series of questions. It can be used for interventions that are planned, in progress or have already taken place. 

A major strength of the system is that it transfers all the generated results into an evaluation report template. Users can then add to the template throughout their evaluation, producing a professional report at the end of the process.

To enable knowledge to be shared and good work promoted, E-valu-it encourages users to publish their final reports on the new [ Road Safety Evaluation website](http://www.roadsafetyevaluation.com/), on their own organisation's website and also that of the [Road Safety Knowledge Centre](http://www.roadsafetyknowledgecentre.org.uk/)

Twelve regional workshops, involving the DfT, RoSPA and local authorities across Britain, are being held as part of the website's development. Road Safety Evaluation is also being supported by 12 regional champions who can explain to potential users the benefits of using E-valu-it.

The website is free to use, and there is no limit to the number of people who can sign up from any one organisation.

Road safety practitioners wanting more information about using the website and E-valu-it should contact Lindsey Simkins, RoSPA's road safety research and evaluation officer, on [lsimkins@rospa.com](mailto:lsimkins@rospa.com).

Christmas drink drive campaign, launched today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.

In addition to running radio advertising, posters in pub washrooms and online search activity, THINK! has teamed up with Coca-Cola's Designated Driver campaign to offer drivers free soft drinks in more than 8,000 participating venues across Britain as part of the Driver Friendly campaign.

Mike Penning said:

>Drivers should be in no doubt that if they get behind the wheel after drinking this Christmas, they risk losing their licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.

>Christmas should be a time for a celebration not a night in the cells. That is why we have teamed up with Coca-Cola and pub chains this Christmas to reward designated drivers as well as reminding drivers of the consequences of getting a drink drive conviction.

>Last year 380 people were killed in accidents where the driver was over the limit. That is why our message is clear: don't drink and drive.

ACPO lead on roads policing, Chief Constable Mick Giannasi said:

>This year we are using information from the public to target those areas where drink driving is a particular problem and so the chances of getting caught are greater than ever.

>If the police stop a driver, and there is any suspicion that they have been drinking, then they will be asked to provide a breath test and drivers should be in no doubt that if they are found to be over the limit they will be brought before the courts. 

>Many drivers don't realise that alcohol stays in the system for a number of hours, and that they could still be over the limit the next morning when driving to work or dropping the children off at school. That is why we are asking drivers to be safe, not sorry, this Christmas.

Jon Woods, Country Manager, Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland said: 

>With Christmas just around the corner, our consumers are gearing up to celebrate. We know how much they enjoy the festive period and we don't want to dampen their spirits. 

>This Christmas we're proud to be partnering with the Government's THINK! initiative to help raise awareness of responsible drinking. By rewarding those drivers who choose not to drink with a free Coke or diet Coke, we can encourage people to do the right thing while still enjoying a great night out. It's a different approach to responsible drinking but our consumers love it.

Designated drivers should ask at the bar about how to take advantage of the buy one soft drink, get one free offer at participating pubs.

The THINK! drink drive radio advertising campaign will run from 1st December 2010 to 1st January 2011 and posters will appear in pub washrooms from 6th December to 2nd January.

An innovative new partnership between the THINK! child road safety campaign and West Bromwich Albion FC was launched today by children from Galton Valley Primary School in Smethwick.

West Bromwich Albion FC will use its after-school clubs and activities in schools and on match days to help youngsters learn about road safety with THINK!'s Tales of the Road materials.

The new initiative will focus on helping six to 11-year-olds learn how to find safe places to cross the road after evidence showed that this is a key factor in helping children stay safe on the roads.

Road Safety Minister, Mike Penning, said:

>Britain's roads are among the safest in the world but last year more than 1,600 children were killed or seriously injured - that's 31 children every week.

>We need to think of new ways to reach children and make sure that they are given the skills they need to keep themselves safe on the roads as they grow up and gain independence.

>That is why I am delighted to announce that THINK! is teaming up with West Bromwich Albion FC to help get the message across through community work, competitions and various other activities in the local schools. I hope that this scheme will see more children gain in knowledge and confidence so that we will see fewer tragedies on the roads.

Over the forthcoming weeks West Bromwich Albion FC will work with ten primary schools across Sandwell, using various fun activities in and out of the classroom to help youngsters learn about road safety with THINK!'s Tales of the Road materials.

Anna Pincher, Education and Learning Development Manager at the West Bromwich Albion Foundation said:

>We've got lots of great activities in store for kids across Sandwell and are thrilled to be a part of this new THINK! initiative. It's essential for children's development that they stay healthy and active. We want to show kids that by following a few basic road safety rules they can avoid road accidents and the consequences associated with them - such as not being able to play the sports or games that they love!

Steve Francis, Road Safety Officer from Sandwell Council, said:

>The West Midlands has a higher than average casualty numbers for children aged six to 11 involved in pedestrian road traffic accidents. However, interestingly research shows that the problem among children in this age group is not a lack of knowledge, but a failure to put this knowledge into practice. Building on the excellent work our road safety team is already carrying out across the area, this exciting new THINK! initiative uses real world interventions and local examples to encourage children to think about how to put their skills into practice and make them habitual.

The four clubs taking part in the new pilot project - Blackburn Rovers, Leeds United, Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion are all based in regions where there are higher than average casualty numbers for children aged six to 11. This work will be supported by local road safety officers and council road safety programmes. 

In addition, THINK! will distribute exercise books with road safety activities to primary schools across the country in January 2011.

## Notes to Editors

  * The safe place to cross toolkit will be available on the [Tales of the Road website ](http://talesoftheroad.direct.gov.uk/grownups.php) along with other resources, for wider community groups to get involved (eg youth clubs) and support the campaign.
  * The data informing this campaign showed""crossing road masked by stationary or parked vehicle"" and ""failed to look properly"" are among the biggest contributory factors reported for child (6-11s) pedestrian Killed and Seriously Injured.(KSI). It was such insight that guided our decision to prioritise the Safe Place to Cross message. 
  * The number of KSI casualties in the West Midlands is 18.7 per 100,000 six to 11 year olds in the region - which is above the national average.
  * The West Midlands launch of the new THINK! Campaign involved children from Galton Valley Primary School climbing aboard the 'Walking Baggie Bird Bus' which was 'driven' by the West Bromwich Albion Mascot himself, Baggie Bird, and Sandwell Road Safety Officers. Together the walking bus explored the best and worst places to cross the road and gave children the chance to put their road safety knowledge into practice.

An extra 16 motorcycle helmets have been rated by SHARP - the Department for Transport's Safety Helmet Assessment and Rating Programme - taking the total number of ratings published to 218.

Mike Penning said:

>We estimate that 50 deaths could be prevented each year if all riders wore the safest helmets available. That is why I am delighted to be announcing new SHARP ratings today ahead of my visit to the Motorcycle Show next week. I urge anyone going to the show who is thinking about buying a new helmet to visit the SHARP stand to find out more. 

>By making sure that motorcyclists have access to the best safety information, promoting further training and safe riding, and reminding drivers to look out for bikers I hope that we can improve safety for motorcyclists and reduce the number of tragedies we see on the roads each year.

All helmets must meet minimum legal safety standards but the SHARP scheme uses a wider range of tests to provide riders with more information on how much protection a helmet can provide in a crash. The objective advice, which includes important guidance on how to select a good fitting helmet, will help riders to choose the safest helmet suitable for them. The SHARP tests - which award ratings of between one and five stars - showed that the safety performance of helmets can vary by as much as 70%. With helmets across a wide price range scoring highly all riders should be able to find a high performing helmet in a size and style that fits them and at a price they want to pay.

Draft amendments to legislation have been laid before Parliament which will, subject to Parliamentary approval, increase the on-the-spot penalty deposits for seatbelt and number plate offences that can be taken from drivers from abroad. This brings them into line with the £60 fixed penalties for those offences. 

Amendments have also been made to increase the fixed penalty for driving or keeping a vehicle with an obscured registration mark, or without a registration plate, from £30 to £60. This change will ensure consistency of those penalties with the level for failing to fix the correct type of registration plate to a vehicle.

Mike Penning said:

>If laws are to be effective then it is vital that they are enforced fairly and proportionately, no matter who you are or where you are from. 

>That is why we want to bring the deposit taken from drivers from abroad for seatbelt offences into line with the fixed penalties we know UK drivers pay. 

>Vehicles without a registration plate or with the plate obscured help law-breakers to avoid detection so it is important that proportionate penalties are in place to deter offenders. Updating the legislation today will make sure the penalties for all registration plate offences are consistent.

The fixed penalty for insufficient motorcycle tread depth will be amended to £60 from £120 to bring it into line with the penalty for other non-commercial vehicles. Again, the amendments laid before Parliament alter the deposit level in respect of this offence.

The new penalty levels are due to come into force on 1 February 2011.

  * Fixed penalty notices issued for certain road traffic offences give the option to pay the penalty in place of a prosecution. A financial penalty deposit can be taken on-the-spot from drivers who have committed certain road traffic offences but who cannot provide a satisfactory UK address.
  * All fixed penalty levels are kept under regular review in order to help ensure that they are broadly consistent with penalty levels for similar offences; are set at an appropriate level to help deter offending; and, are in proportion to court fine levels.
  * The proposed legislative changes will increase the penalty level from £30 to £60 for:   
driving or keeping a vehicle without the required registration mark; and,   
driving or keeping a vehicle with an obscured registration mark.  
the reason for doing so is to increase the levels of compliance with the regulatory requirements about 'number-plates' - since failing to comply with the requirements about registration marks can have significant implications for criminal investigations and also crime detection. The proposed legislative changes will also make it possible for these offences to be enforced more effectively against non-UK-resident drivers - and also the offence of failing to fit a prescribed registration mark.
  * The changes will increase the financial penalty deposit level for seat belt offences from £30 to £60 - so that the amount of financial penalty deposit that can be required from a non-UK resident driver for these offences is the same as the existing fixed penalty level.
  * The changes will also reduce from £120 to £60 the penalty level for insufficient tyre tread depth on a motorcycle tyre. This amendment corrects an earlier inadvertent change and brings the fixed penalty into line with the fixed penalty level for other non-commercial vehicle tyres. The changes will similarly reduce the amount of financial penalty deposit that can be required from a non-UK resident driver for this offence.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101027,THINK! reminds children to be bright to be seen ,Making sure that children are easily seen by drivers is especially important at this time of year when evenings are drawing-in. ,"Children are today being urged to 'be bright and be seen' ahead of the clocks going back this weekend.

The Department for Transport's THINK! road safety campaign is reminding children of some top tips to help them be seen when out and about on the roads. 

Road Safety Minister, Mike Penning, said:

>Britain's roads are among the safest in the world and the number of children killed has fallen by 82% in the last 20 years. However, 81 children still died on our roads last year and we know we need to do more to cut this toll. 

>Making sure that children are easily seen by drivers is important all year round but especially at this time of year when evenings are getting darker. Drivers and riders should also remember to keep a look out for children walking and cycling.

THINK!'s top tips for making sure children are visible when out on the roads are:

1. Wear brightly coloured or fluorescent clothing which shows up well in daylight and at dusk.
2. If you're out and about when it's dark, wear reflective gear to make sure you can be seen in car headlights. Reflective vests, sashes or wristbands work well. Remember, fluorescent clothing doesn't work after dark.
3. Use accessories - even small items such as clip-on reflectors, fluorescent arm bands and stickers on your school bag are a great way to improve your visibility.
4. If you like to cycle, remember that it's the law to have clean and working lights at night (white at the front and red at the back) as well as a rear reflector.
5. Being bright isn't the only way to stay safer. If you're out at night, choose routes and crossing places that are well lit and remember to always use the Green Cross Code.

The THINK! [Tales of the Road website](http://talesoftheroad.direct.gov.uk/be-bright.php) has interactive games and exercises explaining the importance of being visible on the road. 

##  Notes to editors

Stobart Group and Tesco have provided space on the backs of 200 trucks to carry adverts reminding drivers to take regular breaks and not to use mobiles while driving. 

Road Safety Minister, Mike Penning, today visited Stobart Group in Widnes to mark this important partnership and see the campaign in action. 

Mike Penning said:

>The THINK! truck backs campaign is a fantastic example of the public and private sector working together to get across important road safety messages to drivers while they are on the road. 

>By working together Eddie Stobart, Tesco and THINK! have developed a campaign which combines advertising creativity with value for money for the taxpayer.  

>I am very grateful to both companies for their generosity in allowing us to use this space and I hope that other similar initiatives will follow in the future.

Andrew Tinkler, Stobart Group CEO, said: 

>With one of the largest fleets on the UK's roads, and a specialist Eddie Stobart driver training school that all our drivers have to pass through, regardless of experience, road safety is of absolute paramount importance to the Stobart Group.

>It is said that when driving on major UK roads, an Eddie Stobart truck is seen every 4 to 5 minutes, which clearly lends itself very well to promotion and raising public awareness. So we were only too happy to support the DfT with the idea of including the THINK! campaign posters on some of our truck-backs - especially as we so fully endorse the campaign's messages.

The trucks carry one of two adverts: one on the dangers of fatigue, prompting drivers to turn off the road if they are feeling tired; the other reminding drivers that using a mobile phone at the wheel could cost them 3 points on their licence and up to £1,000 in court fines.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The DfT have put up £58,592 funding for printing and fitment of the advertising however the estimated value of the 12 months campaign is £1.5 million - more than 25 times the cost to the DfT.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100629,New powers to tackle dangerous vehicles,More flexibility in tackling vehicles suspected of being overloaded or breaking operating or driving hours rules.,"Increased powers to crack down on dangerous trucks and coaches were set out today by Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31.

The proposals would give the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) more flexibility in tackling vehicles they suspect of being overloaded or breaking operating or driving hours rules. 

The new powers would also help VOSA to enforce new cabotage rules, which govern the amount of UK domestic work hauliers from outside the UK can undertake.

Today's consultation also outlines plans to give VOSA officers in Scotland the power to independently stop commercial vehicles for the first time.  Currently, all VOSA enforcement in Scotland is assisted by the police.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>If our roads are to remain among the safest in the world we need to make sure that the drivers and vehicles on our roads are fit to be there.  VOSA's work is vital in keeping dangerous vehicles and drivers off the road.

>The measures I am announcing today will make sure that rogue operators have nowhere to hide by ensuring that VOSA inspectors across Great Britain have all the powers they need to stop vehicles that may pose a threat to road safety. 

>These plans will also help VOSA to enforce the rules governing the amount of domestic work hauliers from outside the UK can undertake, helping to make sure that UK operators do not face unfair competition for business.

>The new powers will also free up police time as VOSA will be able to operate more independently.

Currently, VOSA inspectors can only independently stop drivers if they suspect there is a fault with the vehicle - although they can and do then check for other offences.   These new plans would extend VOSA's powers and allow their inspectors - without the need for police assistance - to pull drivers over to check that they are complying with rules on maximum weight limits, driving hours, operator licensing and cabotage.

The planned changes will also include new measures to allow the VOSA Chief Executive to authorise inspectors to stop vehicles rather than needing to get accreditation from individual police forces.  This is a significant streamlining of bureaucratic process and will free up VOSA time and resource to concentrate on front-line enforcement.

The [consultation](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512173431/http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2010-27/consultation.pdf) will close on 13th August 2010.

## Notes to Editors:

  * In 2009/10 VOSA carried out roadworthiness checks on 173,951 heavy goods vehicles including 99,507 vehicles from outside the UK.
  * 12,232 roadworthiness checks were carried out on buses and coaches.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100608,Motorcycle test and training review ordered by Transport Minister,DfT review will  look at testing and training of motorcycle riders.,"A review of the motorcycle testing and training regime was today announced by Road Safety Minister, Mike Penning.

The two-part motorcycle test was introduced in April 2009 to meet the requirements of the second EU Directive on driving licences. 

The Minister ordered the review after listening to concerns from motorcycle groups and visiting a test centre to look at the testing procedure in more detail. Ways to improve training will also be considered.

Mike Penning said:

""Road safety is a top priority and the testing and training on offer is vital in our work to cut the disproportionately high numbers of motorcyclists killed and injured on our roads each year.

>It is clear there are concerns among the motorcycling community about the safety of the new test's off-road module. There have also been complaints about the difficulty for riders in some areas of accessing the off-road test centres.

>That is why I am today asking riders, safety groups and motorcycle industry representatives to come forward with their ideas for how testing and training can be improved to ensure we produce safe, confident and responsible riders.

The new test was introduced in order to meet the requirements of the second EU Directive on driving licences.  While most elements in the off-road module 1 test are required by the Directive, there may be scope to make some changes to the way in which the test is carried out.  

The DfT review will look at the manoeuvres carried out in both modules 1 (off-road) and 2 (on-road) and whether these manoeuvres could safely be conducted in the on-road test. 

The review will also look at other related motorcycle testing and training issues, including the options for training and testing for progressive access under the third driving licence directive and how any changes relate to wider proposals to improve motorcycle training and testing. 

Views are welcome from motorcycle riders, trainers, road safety groups, the wider public and others on what aspects of the motorcycle test should be looked at, including how and where they think motorcycle testing might best and most safely be carried out. 

The precise scope and terms of reference of the review will be determined following discussions with motorcycle groups and other interested parties, with the aim of concluding the review by the autumn. 

Views should be submitted to the Department for Transport by 31 July.

## Notes to Editors:

  * Views can be sent to the DfT by[ email](mailto:RUSD4consultation@dft.gsi.gov.uk)
  * The current motorcycle test was introduced in April 2009 and is taken in two parts:   
- Module 1 contains the specified manoeuvres element of the test including exercises designed to assess the rider's ability to control their machine safely, including avoidance and emergency stop exercises.  
- Module 2 includes an eyesight test and at least 30 minutes of on road riding.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100527,New motorcycle helmet ratings on new website ,SHARP - a new website to give motorcyclists the best advice and information on choosing a helmet.,"New safety ratings for motorcycle helmets were announced today by Road Safety Minister, Mike Penning, as he unveiled a new website to give motorcyclists the best advice and information on choosing a helmet.

An extra 27 motorcycle helmets have been rated by SHARP - the Department for Transport's Safety Helmet Assessment and Rating Programme - taking the total number of ratings published past the 200 mark.

All these ratings are today published on the new [SHARP website](http://www.direct.gov.uk/sharp) which has been overhauled to include more information for motorcyclists on how to find the right helmet for them.  The site also includes demonstrations of how the SHARP tests are carried out and how to make sure a helmet fits properly.   

In addition, new in-store information leaflets are being made available for retailers to give them and their customers more information about the SHARP scheme. 

Mike Penning said:

>We estimate that 50 deaths could be prevented each year if all riders wore the safest helmets available.  That is why I am delighted to be announcing additional SHARP ratings today at the same time as the new and improved SHARP website is launched.

>By making sure that motorcyclists have access to the best safety information, promoting further training and safe riding, and reminding drivers to look out for bikers I hope that we can improve safety for motorcyclists and reduce the number of tragedies we see on the roads each year.

All helmets must meet minimum legal safety standards but the SHARP scheme uses a wider range of tests to provide riders with more information on how much protection a helmet can provide in a crash. The objective advice, which includes important guidance on how to select a good fitting helmet, will help riders to choose the safest helmet suitable for them. The SHARP tests - which award ratings of between one and five stars - show that the safety performance of helmets can vary by as much as 70 per cent. With helmets across a wide price range scoring highly all riders should be able to find a high performing helmet in a size and style that fits them and at a price they want to pay.

The new website was developed in response to feedback from consumers and the motorcycle industry and SHARP is inviting motorcyclists to continue giving feedback on the new site so that it best meets their needs.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/stories/dft-news-20120104,Government to establish expert panel on drug driving,How the Department for Transport is establishing an expert panel to consider the technical aspects of introducing a new offence of driving.,"The Department for Transport is establishing an expert panel to consider the technical aspects of introducing a new offence of driving with an illegal drug in your body.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>Britain has some of the safest roads in the world but we know how important it is to tackle the menace of drug driving.

>That is why we are putting together a panel of experts to give us advice on the technical aspects of introducing a new offence of driving with an illegal drug in your body. The panel will look at how such an offence could be defined as well as considering whether it is possible to set levels for the impairing effects of specific drugs.

The Department's response to the North review made it clear that driving while impaired by drugs is as important an issue as drink-driving. It is now relatively easy to enforce the law against drink-driving, while the equally serious driving whilst impaired by drugs is more difficult to deal with effectively.

The Department said that it would examine the case for a new specific drug driving offence - alongside the existing one - which would relieve the need for the police to prove impairment case-by-case where a specified drug had been detected.

That is why the Department is putting together a panel of experts to give advice on the technical aspects of introducing a new offence of driving with an illegal drug in your body. The panel will look at how such an offence could be defined as well as considering whether it is possible to set levels for the impairing effects of specific drugs.

The panel's terms of reference are under development and are likely to be finalised when the panel has been fully assembled and starts work. This is expected to be in the Spring.

It is likely that the panel will consider whether it is possible to identify, for average members of the adult population, the levels of drugs that have an impairing effect broadly equivalent to the current blood alcohol level. They will consider this effect for a number of drugs including cocaine, MDMA, cannabis, and opiates.

The Highway Code applies to England, Scotland and Wales. It's essential reading for everyone.

The most vulnerable road users are pedestrians, particularly children, older or disabled people, cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders.

It is important that all road users are aware of the code and are considerate towards each other. This applies to pedestrians as much as to drivers and riders.

Knowing and applying the rules contained in The Highway Code could significantly reduce road casualties. Cutting the number of deaths and injuries that occur on our roads every day is a responsibility we all share.",12/19/2011,making-roads-safer,,Driving Standards Agency,,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/stories/dsa-news-20111212,Changes to the theory test: the facts,From 23 January 2012 the theory test will be made up of multiple-choice questions which are no longer published in learning materials.,"From 23 January 2012 the theory test will be made up of multiple-choice questions which are no longer published in learning materials.

The reason behind the move is to stop candidates from simply memorising theory test questions and answers and learning by rote.

## Revision materials still available

New official driving and riding theory books were published in September 2011 to help candidates prepare for the test and for life on the road.

The new books contain:

  * new sections of text for motorcyclists, a free e-book for car drivers and full references throughout to help candidates learn and revise
  * questions and answers for revision, including practice for case studies
  * the official DSA explanations for every revision question, helping candidates fully understand the answer

This approach to learning will help candidates to gain a better knowledge and understanding of driving theory which will help them respond correctly to the new, reworded live questions used in the actual test.

## No changes to the format of the test

No changes are being made to the format of the theory test. It will still be made up of a multiple-choice part and a hazard perception part.

The time allowed and the pass marks will stay the same.

  * Mid Wales
  * East and West Yorkshire
  * Cumbria
  * Stoke-on-Trent

DSA may also consider other areas for casual hire sites, but this will depend on location and demand. If you're a driver or rider trainer who knows of any suitable sites ready to use, then DSA would like to hear from you.

Any sites you suggest must:

  * have suitable examiner accommodation, so will require office space and toilets as a minimum
  * be available for weekday or weekend use
  * have a surface with little or no work needed to bring up to a suitable standard, so it must: 
    * be relatively flat
    * have a good quality tarmac surface with no significant hazards near the riding line such as drains, kerbs, posts, potholes or other damage

DSA won't consider any sites where the surface isn't suitable; for example, if it's made up of concrete, gravel, or compressed hardcore.

On road access for module two isn't necessary. You could also consider areas where road markings or paint need to be removed.

## Motorcycle test module one site size options

### A standard area:

  * an area of 125 metres long and 40 metres wide 

### A hockey stick shaped layout:

This may become an option. DSA uses these at VOSA sites:

  * the short end of the hockey stick needs to be around 40 metres long by at least five metres wide
  * the straight should lead in to a 20 to 30 metre radius bend, travelling through at least 90 degrees
  * after the bend a straight section of approximately 100 metres long by at least 12 metres wide is required, there should be 35 metres (plus or minus four metres) from the exit of the bend to the two red cones at the start of the speed measuring channel 
  * an area of about 40 by 20 metres should be available for the slower speed exercises

There's some flexibility in the above dimensions as they may have to be varied to suit the local area. Please bear these options in mind when considering potential sites.

While most motorcycle trainers encourage their pupils to wear the best protective motorcycle gear that they can afford, some candidates aren't following this advice. 

DSA doesn't want to restrict candidates to wearing the most expensive protective motorcycle clothing. However, DSA's examiners won't ignore or condone riding a motorcycle or scooter while wearing unsuitable clothing.

## Tests won't go ahead if you are inappropriately dressed

From 1 July, examiners might tell you that your test won't go ahead if you arrive inappropriately dressed. However, where possible, examiners will give you the chance to find suitable clothing within the time available. 

DSA won't pay out-of-pocket expenses if your test is cancelled because of inappropriate clothing.

## Guide to suitable clothing

As a general guide the following is an indication of the minimum level of clothing acceptable:

  * motorcycle boots 
  * sturdy footwear or boots that provide support and ankle protection
  * textile or leather motorcycle trousers
  * heavy denim trousers
  * heavy denim jacket with several layers underneath
  * textile or leather motorcycle jacket
  * motorcycle gloves

The following are examples of clothing that are not acceptable:

  * lightweight training shoes
  * canvas basket ball trainers
  * any form of clothing with areas of exposed skin
  * shell suit or lightweight tracksuit
  * distressed ripped jeans
  * lightweight fleece or hoody
  * no gloves or skiing gloves

In all cases it's a legal requirement that riders wear an approved and correctly fastened motorcycle helmet,* with suitable eye protection (*an exception is made for members of the Sikh religion wearing a turban).

## Cases of inappropriate clothing

Recently there have been cases where candidates have arrived unsuitably dressed for the practical test. This has included wearing lightweight nylon shell suits, lightweight canvas training shoes, or wearing no gloves. 

One of these cases resulted in the test not going ahead.

## More advice and guidance

Clothing is one of the subjects covered in element A of compulsory basic training (CBT).

Further advice and guidance for candidates on the right clothing to wear can be found:

## If you have used an unofficial website

DSA gets complaints from customers who have used unofficial booking websites. In most cases these websites are doing nothing illegal. This means that DSA's powers to respond may be limited. 

If you have used an unofficial booking website, you might have seven working days to cancel your order and get all your money back. However, this will depend on the terms and conditions of the website you used. 

You can find more information about your consumer rights on Directgov. You can also use template letters to complain to businesses. Each letter includes details of the law that you want the trader to follow.

## What DSA is doing about unofficial booking websites

DSA takes consumer protection very seriously. So, DSA is: 

  * protecting its trademarks to make sure they are not: 
    * used to advertise unofficial booking sites in search engine results 
    * used as part of website addresses for unofficial booking websites 
  * asking the Advertising Standards Authority to make sure unofficial booking websites are following the rules in the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing 
  * asking local Trading Standards to investigate those unofficial booking websites that appear to be misleading consumers

## What DSA is doing to promote the official booking service

DSA makes improvements based on learner drivers' feedback to promote the official booking service. For example DSA: 

  * made sure that the official Directgov website pages appear at the top of search engine results where possible 
  * created videos showing how to use the practical test booking service - videos are being developed for the theory test booking service too 
  * reminded learner drivers on Twitter and Facebook about using the official booking service on Directgov

This mainly affects DSA staff processes but also amends existing approved training bodies' (ATBs) responsibilities.

This revised procedure should allow DSA to make sure the right level of support is given to those individuals involved in serious or major incidents. More robust recording will allow the agency to establish any lessons learned which could help to develop improvements to procedures in the future.

## What this will cover

It will cover a range of motorcycle activities including both off road and on road testing and training.

### Off-road incidents

For incidents taking place off road, during:

  * module one testing
  * ATB activities on an motorcycle manoeuvring area (MMA)
  * compulsory basic training (CBT) activity at an ATB site
  * direct access scheme (DAS) activity at an ATB site

### On-road incidents

For incidents taking place on road, during:

  * module two testing
  * any motorcycle incident involving a member of staff on DSA business
  * CBT training during element E
  * DAS training

The revised procedure does not cover training activities for register of post-test motorcycle training or enhanced rider scheme.

This working group includes DSA, DfT, the motorcycle training industry and motorcycle user groups.

This work (along with DSA's ongoing monitoring and review process of all tests) has identified a number of minor changes that can be quickly introduced before the main review is finished. 

The following provides you with an outline of the minor changes DSA intends to introduce to module one with effect from 16 May 2011.

## On this page:

  * Change to the sequence of the manoeuvres
  * Controlled stop
  * Emergency stop
  * Choosing preferred riding line
  * The slow ride
  * Altering requirements for the controlled stop following the avoidance exercise
  * Flexibility of speed assessment
  * Rider faults
  * Summary
  * Revised sequence of set exercises for module one of motorcycle test
  * Motorcycle manoeuvring area (MMA) diagrams

## Change to the sequence of the manoeuvres (see revised order below)

So that all the slow speed elements will be carried out before the higher speed exercises. This will allow candidates to demonstrate the necessary competence in motorcycle control before moving onto the more demanding manoeuvres.

## Controlled stop

This provides an opportunity for candidates to ride the circuit bend of the motorcycle manoeuvring area before coming to a controlled stop. There will not be a minimum speed requirement to this manoeuvre which will allow the candidates the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the layout before moving on to the emergency stop.

## Emergency stop

This is to take place before the avoidance exercise. If candidates fail the emergency stop they will not be permitted to carry out the avoidance exercise. This is so that only sufficiently prepared candidates will undertake the avoidance exercise.

## Choosing preferred riding line

Re-position cones on the exit of both left and right hand bends to allow the rider to choose their preferred riding line. 

## The slow ride

This will now be conducted whilst the candidate rides between the figure of eight and the U-turn manoeuvres. The examiner will observe rather than walk beside the candidate. This will make for a smoother transition from one manoeuvre to another whilst compensating for the extra time required for the candidate to benefit from the additional ride around the circuit bend.

## Altering requirements for the controlled stop following the avoidance exercise

The requirements for the controlled stop following the avoidance exercise will be altered. The first pair of blue cones that currently form the stopping box will be removed for this exercise. The examiner will ask the candidate to stop between the remaining two blue cones. This will allow the candidate a greater length to stop in and also allows flexibility in where they stop. Candidates will still be required to stop under control.

## Flexibility of speed assessment

For the high speed manoeuvres, those candidates who reach 47 km/h or less will be asked to repeat the exercise providing they haven't committed a serious or dangerous fault and providing their riding doesn't indicate it would be unsafe to continue. A rider fault will be assessed as the candidate hasn't achieved the minimum speed.

If the candidate fails to achieve the required minimum speed at the second attempt, a serious fault will be recorded.

Candidates who fail to reach the minimum speed requirement but who achieve 48 or 49 km/h won't be asked to repeat the exercise; a rider fault will be assessed in addition to any other control or observation faults. No more than one fault can be recorded for these exercises.

Candidates will still be required to stop under control.

(This section was updated on 13 June 2011)

## Rider faults

The maximum number of rider faults a successful candidate is allowed will remain at five; the number of attempts allowed for the higher speed exercises will also remain unchanged. 

## Summary

To summarise, these changes are designed to address those aspects the motorcycle industry felt needed to be changed.

The key message is that the exercises will remain the same; it is mainly the order in which they are delivered that will change. This will give candidates more time to settle down and familiarise themselves with the updated layout. This will also give them the opportunity to build up their speed gradually, reducing the risk of candidates riding too fast.

## Revised sequence of set exercises for module one of motorcycle test

  * manual handling
  * slow control steering (slalom and figure of eight)
  * slow ride: this will be observed as the candidate rides to the next exercise
  * U-turn
  * circuit bend and controlled stop carried out between 30 km/h and 50 km/h (about 20 mph to 30 mph) followed by a controlled stop in the area marked by the four blue cones; speed not measured
  * cornering and emergency stop; speed measured
  * cornering, avoidance exercise and controlled stop; speed measured

If you do not have a photo card licence and counterpart to prove your identity but have an old-style paper one, you must bring this and a valid passport.

For more information about the cancellation of identity cards visit [direct.gov.uk/identity](http://www.direct.gov.uk/identity).

Mr Cook, who was first appointed in January 2011, will focus on supporting the Transport Secretary's ambitious programme for reforming the strategic road network while ensuring that the Agency continues to deliver its business against tough efficiency targets.

Mike Penning, Minister for Roads said:

>This is a challenging time for the Highways Agency but I am confident that Alan Cook is the right person to work with Ministers towards achieving the Agency's transformation into a more efficient, business-like and commercially-focused operator, which crucially does much more to listen and respond to the needs of road users.

>His extensive experience will also help support the Agency in taking forward my roads reform agenda to improve how we operate, maintain and enhance our major roads which are the backbone of Britain, getting people to and from work, powering the economy and keeping families connected.

In May, the Transport Secretary published her response to Alan Cook's independent review of the strategic road network. The Transport Secretary also set out ambitious plans to increase the quality and efficiency of the network, offering a better service to motorists and business users.

Mr Cook's role will see him providing advice to senior staff and making sure the Agency delivers on changes identified in his independent review.

He will also offer advice on organisational change and provide views on alternative operating models which are currently being developed as part of a feasibility study announced by the Prime Minister in March.

Mr Cook said:

>I welcome the opportunity to continue in the role of chairman for a further 12 months in order to both assist with the crucially important feasibility study and also help the Agency mobilise its own change programme.

>This programme will deliver the changes identified in the Government's response to my independent review with the aim of the Highways Agency becoming a best-in-class executive agency.

The scheme will give all 10 councils in Greater Manchester more powers to co-ordinate road works and take tough action against companies who break the rules - including issuing fines of up to £5,000.

The authorities are Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan.

It follows other schemes rolled out elsewhere in the country. But this will be the first to be administered by a central body - Transport for Greater Manchester - rather than individual councils in order to reduce costs and provide a more efficient service across the region.

The scheme requires anyone carrying out road works to apply for a permit in advance and allows councils to set conditions on timing, coordination and the amount of road space left available to road users.

Companies who work without a permit or break the conditions will be fined.

Norman Baker said:

>I am pleased to be able to give the go ahead for this permit scheme.

>Although we all know that road works are sometimes unavoidable, the disruption they cause can be a hugely frustrating for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians as well as costing businesses time and money. That is why it is important that councils use the powers they have to make sure utility firms carry out works with consideration for those who use the road.

>We are determined to tackle problem road works and make sure that those who dig up the road are made accountable when unnecessary disruption occurs.

The Greater Manchester scheme follows others introduced by Bedford Borough Council, Hertfordshire County Council, Luton Borough Council, Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, Kent County Council, Northamptonshire County Council, London councils, St Helens Borough Council and authorities in parts of Yorkshire.

These councils are monitoring their schemes to make sure they are producing benefits for local residents and feeding this information back to the Department for Transport.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The Greater Manchester joint permit scheme has been approved by the Government after meeting the requirements of the Traffic Management Act 2004 and The Traffic Management Permit Scheme (England) Regulations 2007.
  2. The 10 authorities have been asked to nominate the preferred date for the scheme to come into effect. DfT officials will work with the councils to give effect to the scheme on that date, by means of a Statutory Instrument.
  3. A council running a permit scheme is able to charge companies for providing a permit although any charge should cover costs and should not result in a surplus. It will be a criminal offence to work without a permit. The maximum fine will be £5,000. It will be an offence to not meet a permit condition, for which the maximum fine is £2,500. Fixed Penalty Notices, as an alternative enforcement mechanism, can also be given for working without a permit or not meeting a permit condition. Councils in England have been able to apply to the Department for Transport to run their own street works permit schemes since the relevant Regulations came into force in April 2008.
  4. The 10 Greater Manchester authorities are responsible for the details of its scheme, and the timetable for its introduction.
  5. As a joint scheme, it will be administered by a shared service centre hosted by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) acting on behalf of all the other authorities over their combined areas. Co-ordinating the scheme in this way will not only lead to reduced costs, compared to 10 individually run schemes, but will better support the delivery of an efficient, reliable and consistent service for utility companies and road users across the whole of the Greater Manchester network.

The Department for Transport has today launched a [consultation putting forward the UK's plans for applying Europe-wide regulations that aim to ensure bus and coach passengers have similar legal protection to those using other forms of transport](/consultations/dft-2012-19/).

The regulation, which mainly applies to journeys over 155 miles (250km), lays out the responsibilities of operators and terminal owners in the case of delays, cancellations, accidents and other issues affecting passengers, including disabled passengers and passengers with reduced mobility.

Transport Minister, Norman Baker, said: 

>We want people taking coach trips and long-distance bus journeys to get a fair deal. However, we also want to avoid tying operators up in expensive and unnecessary burdens.

>I believe that the approach outlined in this consultation finds the right balance between passenger protection and operator competitiveness and I hope that groups likely to be affected by these changes will agree when they respond to our proposals.

The consultation opens today and closes on 11 October 2012.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The consultation can be found on the [Department for Transport website](/consultations/dft-2012-19/).
  2. The vast majority of these regulations will apply only to journeys over 250km (155 miles).

A major new road scheme involving tolling will be added to the Department for Transport's programme of major projects. Subject to agreement with interested local authorities on a funding package and decisions at the next Spending Review construction work could begin by 2018.

The plans are designed to address congestion and long term capacity issues on and around the strategically crucial A14.

They include a new bypass to replace the existing road around Huntingdon and upgrades along the A14 as far east as Milton. Two new roads would be built in parallel to, with one on each side of, the current A14 immediately north of Cambridge for local use. Meanwhile, the existing A14 carriageway will be upgraded through the removal of accesses and junctions, and improvements to junctions at the northern and southern ends.

Study work has confirmed that funding for these can be generated in part through tolling a length of the enhanced A14, featuring around 20 miles of new or widened road. However, more work will be taken to determine the best tolling solution, including what length the tolled section should be, how users would pay and what the tariff should be.

The schemes will now enter the DfT roads programme and begin detailed design and statutory processes. They are dependent on local government and commercial decision making and will now be considered in more detail by the relevant local authorities and local enterprise partnerships.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>The A14 is a crucial strategic route for the east of England, vital not only for international road traffic using the port of Felixstowe but everyone who relies on it daily.

>This is why my department has been working hard to generate innovative and imaginative solutions to tackling long term congestion and I am pleased to be able to unveil what we believe to be the best option for people living locally as well as those who see it as a lifeline to international markets.

>It demonstrates yet again that this coalition government is focused on delivering economic growth and our determination to do everything we can to support delivery of key national infrastructure.

The A14 road improvement package includes:

  * Widening of the Cambridge Northern Bypass between Milton and Girton and enhancement of the Girton Interchange;
  * Provision of high standard roads for local traffic use running in parallel to an enhanced A14 carriageway between Girton and the area near the current Trinity Foot A14 junction;
  * Construction of a bypass to the south of Huntingdon between the area near Trinity Foot and the A1, at both ends tying in with the existing A14.

A major road scheme between Ellington and Fen Ditton was cancelled in 2010 on affordability grounds. Since then the DfT has been working with local authorities and businesses through the A14 Challenge on alternatives to the previous scheme. Today's announcement is the outcome of this work.

The government has also identified a package of desirable rail investment that will include major improvements at Ely, Peterborough and Leicester, which will enable more freight to be carried by rail between Felixstowe and Nuneaton. The Secretary of State has allocated £200m to the Strategic Freight Network to fund network enhancements of this kind at the request of the rail freight industry.

## Notes to Editors

  1. Also announced today is government support for a package of local public transport improvements which could include: 
    * Commercial express bus services between Peterborough and Cambridge;
    * A new park & ride site at Alconbury;
    * Park & ride bus services to Cambridge via the Busway;
    * A new 'Number 5' local bus service from Bar Hill to Cambridge via Science Park and Cambridge Science Park station.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120713a,Local authorities given further support to make roads safer,Updated speed limit guidance to help local authorities improve safety on their roads was published for consultation today by Mike Penning MP.,"Updated speed limit guidance to help local authorities improve safety on their roads was published for consultation today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.

The guidance provides up-to-date advice to aid greater consistency of speed limits on local roads across England. It incorporates recent changes that have increased flexibility for local authorities to implement 20mph limits and zones where it can be shown that they benefit road safety and quality of life.

It also gives authorities more information about the new speed limit appraisal web tool which will help authorities fully assess the impact of any change to a speed limit in their area.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>It is vital that speed limits are suitable for local conditions and councils are best placed to determine what these limits are, based on local knowledge and the views of the community.

>To help, we are publishing updated guidance for consultation. This includes a number of initiatives we have introduced to improve road safety, including making it easier for local authorities and communities to put in place 20 mph schemes, or use common-sense measures such as variable speed limits outside schools.

>Road safety is a top priority and the guidance - along with the speed limit appraisal web tool - will help councils make evidence based decisions to introduce local speed limits that reflect the needs of all road users.

The revision of the guidance and the introduction of an economic tool to help authorities assess the full costs and benefits of any proposed schemes were a commitment in the Department for Transport's Strategic Framework for Road Safety published last year.

The guidance is aimed at local authorities in England. The consultation document can be found here [http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-32](/consultations/dft-2012-32). The final guidance is expected to be published by the end of the year.

The web tool, also to be launched later this year, is being developed with input from road safety groups and local authorities.

### Notes to editors:

  1. This guidance is to be used for setting all local speed limits on single and dual carriageway roads in both urban and rural areas. Local traffic authorities are responsible for determining speed limits on the local road network.
  2. The objectives of this guidance are: 
    * the provision of up-to-date and consistent advice to traffic authorities;
    * improved clarity which will aid greater consistency of speed limits across the country;
    * enabling the setting of more appropriate local speed limits, including lower or higher limits where conditions dictate;
    * achieving local speed limits that better reflect the needs of all road users, not just motorised vehicles;
    * ensuring improved quality of life for local communities and a better balance between road safety, accessibility and environmental objectives, especially in rural communities;
    * improved recognition and understanding by road users of the risks involved on different types of road, the speed limits that apply, and the reasons why;
    * improved respect for speed limits, and in turn improved compliance; and
    * continued reductions in the number of road traffic collisions, injuries and deaths in which excessive or inappropriate speed is a contributory factor.
  3. The key factors that are taken into account in any decisions on local speed limits are: 
    * history of collisions, including frequency, severity, types and causes;
    * road geometry and engineering (e.g. bends, junctions, barriers);
    * presence of vulnerable road users;
    * road function;
    * existing traffic speeds; and
    * road environment, including level of road-side development and possible impacts on residents (e.g. severance, noise, or air quality).

>I am delighted to be able to give the go ahead for this permit scheme.

>Although we all know that road works are sometimes unavoidable, the disruption they cause can be a hugely frustrating for road users and pedestrians alike, as well as costing businesses time and money. That is why it is important that councils use the powers they have to make sure utility firms carry out works with consideration for those who use the road.

> ""We are determined to tackle problem road works and make sure that those who dig up the road are made accountable when disruption occurs.

The East of England permit scheme is the latest to be granted approval, following Kent County Council, Northamptonshire County Council, London councils, St Helens and authorities in parts of Yorkshire.

These councils are monitoring their schemes to make sure they are producing benefits for local residents and feeding this information back to the Department for Transport.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The East of England permit scheme has been approved by the Government after meeting the requirements of the Traffic Management Act 2004 and The Traffic Management Permit Scheme (England) Regulations 2007.
  2. The four authorities have been asked to nominate the preferred date for the scheme to come into effect. DfT officials will work with the councils to give effect to the scheme on that date, by means of a Statutory Instrument.
  3. A council running a permit scheme is able to charge companies for providing a permit although any charge should cover costs and should not result in a surplus. It will be a criminal offence to work without a permit. The maximum fine will be £5,000. It will be an offence to not meet a permit condition, for which the maximum fine is £2,500. Fixed Penalty Notices, as an alternative enforcement mechanism, can also be given for working without a permit or not meeting a permit condition. Councils in England have been able to apply to the Department for Transport to run their own street works permit schemes since the relevant Regulations came into force in April 2008.
  4. The four east of England authorities are responsible for the details of its scheme, and the timetable for its introduction.

The investment - for use by English local authorities outside London - is in addition to the £15m awarded to Transport for London in March to tackle accident hotspots where cyclists have been killed or seriously injured. This has already delivered improvements at a number of sites in the capital with other junctions set to benefit over the next few months.

Local authorities will need to submit bids to the Department for Transport for a share of the latest fund. We will also be looking to the local authorities themselves to contribute further money, in order to maximise the work that can be undertaken.

Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>I am delighted to be able to provide today a further £15m to improve cycle safety, by enabling local authorities to tackle proven dangerous junctions. This investment - alongside a number of other initiatives we have progressed - will make our roads a safer place for everyone using them.

>Cycling is a fantastic way of getting fit, reducing congestion and improving the environment, and cyclist safety matters hugely.

Details of the new fund were being outlined today to the Department's Cycling Forum, which includes cycling, motoring, and road safety groups, who have been working together to find ways to improve cycle safety. The Department will now work in partnership with local authorities and the forum to identify the most important junctions to have safety improvements. This process will use analysis of accident data to highlight potential sites for improvement.

Decisions on how the money will be allocated are likely to be announced in the Autumn.

The investment is the latest Government action to improve cycling safety.

The Department is already giving £1.8 billion of funding to local councils enabling them to design solutions appropriate to their local transport challenges, including improving their road infrastructure to encourage and support cycling.

Furthermore, the vast majority of projects being funded under the Department's £560 million Local Sustainable Transport Fund contain a cycling element.

Ministers recently announced a new allocation of £15 million for better cycle routes and facilities across the country.

The Department has also made it simpler for councils to put in place 20mph zones and limits, and install Trixi mirrors to improve the visibility of cyclists at junctions, by reducing bureaucracy.

Under the current legislation, it takes a minimum of 45 days to prevent an instructor from continuing to give paid driving instruction. However, from 13 July, the registrar of approved driving instructors will have the power to immediately suspend the registration or trainee licence of an instructor who presents a significant danger to the safety of the public. 

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>Driving instructors play a vital role in helping to ensure Britain's roads remain among the safest in the world. 

>The vast majority of instructors meet the extremely high standards we require of them, but in the very rare cases where an instructor presents a significant danger to the public, it is right that we take prompt and effective action to protect learners and other road users.

The registrar is likely to exercise the suspension power in cases where instructors have been convicted of a violent or sexual offence or are delivering tuition of a dangerously low standard, while the formal removal or revocation processes are being completed. 

Instructors retain the right of appeal against a decision to remove them from the register of approved driving instructors or to revoke their trainee licence. The instructor will be able to apply for compensation in respect of the period of suspension if they are not subsequently removed from the register.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120614b,New penalties to tackle careless driving,Careless drivers will be targeted under new proposals announced for consultation today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.,"Careless drivers will be targeted under [new proposals announced for consultation](/consultations/dft-2012-25/) today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.

The proposals would make fixed penalty notices available for careless driving, giving the police greater flexibility in dealing with less serious careless driving offences and freeing them from resource intensive enforcement processes. The fixed penalty will also enable the police to offer educational training as an alternative to endorsement. Drivers would still be able to appeal any decision in court.

Mike Penning said:

>Careless driving is a major public concern and a cause of deaths and injuries on our roads.

>These changes support both police enforcement and, for some cases, the associated offer of educational training for motorists unaware of the full, potential consequences of driving carelessly.

>We also need to make sure that the penalties for a wide range of fixed penalty motoring offences are set at reasonable levels, consistent with the potentially severe consequences of some infingements.

The proposed fixed penalty for careless driving will be £90 with three points on the driver's licence. The most serious example will continue to go through court, where offenders may face higher penalties.

Other proposals announced for consultation today also include plans to increase the payment levels for many motoring fixed penalty offences, such as speeding, not wearing a seat belt and using a mobile phone whilst driving. The proposals would see penalties for these offences increase from £60 to £90. Similar increases to other fixed penalties are also being considered for non-endorsable offences (such as vehicle defects) insurance offences and graduated fixed penalties (such as driver hour regulations).

There are no plans to make any changes to penalty levels for parking offences.

Fixed penalty levels for most of these motoring offences have not increased since the year 2000, and are now lower than other penalties of a similar severity.

The consultation opens today and will close on 5 September 2012. The consultation document can be found at [http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-25/](/consultations/dft-2012-25/).

## Notes for Editors

  1. At present, the police can enforce careless driving offences by the following methods: issue a warning with no further action or summons to court for the more serious cases. The offence attracts between 3-9 penalty points, a fine of up to £5,000 and discretionary disqualification. There is a separate offence for causing death by careless driving, which has higher penalties, including mandatory disqualification and the option of a custodial sentence.
  2. In 2010, 322 deaths had 'careless, reckless or in a hurry' recorded as a contributory factor . This may be an underestimate as there are other contributory factors (e.g. failing to look properly) that could be included as careless driving.
  3. Proposals to increase the levels for most motoring fixed penalty notice (FPN) offences, include increasing many £60 FPNs (usually endorsable) to £90. These offences include speeding, mobile phone use, passing red traffic lights and pedestrian crossing and not wearing a seat belt whilst driving. Increasing non endorsable £30 FPNs to £45 (offences include vehicle defects, lighting, noise or traffic regulation orders). Increasing the FPN for driving a vehicle without a minimum of 3rd insurance from £200 to £300. We are also considering views on increasing the fixed penalty for keeping a vehicle without insurance (currently £100, but £50 if paid within 21 days) and graduated fixed penalties (which mainly relate to drivers hours and overloading offences) by a similar proportion.

She made the comments during a visit to Weymouth and Portland today to view preparations for the Olympic and Paralympic sailing events.

Overnight accommodation is still available in the area, but Olympic visitors planning to attend should book now or risk disappointment.

She also urged people travelling by car for the day to pre-book spaces at the temporary park-and-ride sites now and those intending to travel by rail or coach to book their seats now. Those driving into the area for a few days or more should check on the availability of parking in advance with where they are staying.

Justine Greening said:

>I want to make sure that everyone - visitors, businesses, hoteliers and others - makes the most of the Games coming to Dorset.

>Weymouth and Portland will be a great Olympic location and we want people to come and enjoy the experience.

>But with the area being so popular anyway as a tourist destination, when you add in the Olympics it will be exceptionally busy. To help minimise congestion on the roads, it is vital that people plan ahead. So however you're planning to get to Weymouth, don't wait - sort out your travel plans now and make sure you're ahead of the game for a fantastic summer of sport.

Locally, residents and visitors alike are being encouraging to walk, cycle or use public transport and consider car sharing where that is an option.

Olympic Board chair and transport spokesperson Angus Campbell explains:

>We have been planning our Olympic transport operation for the last four years, with all agencies working together to make sure road networks run as smoothly as possible, minimising disruption for local residents and businesses.
 
>Hosting the Olympic and Paralympic sailing events has enabled us to make huge road and transport improvements across the borough, with more than £120M invested in projects such as the Weymouth Relief Road, intelligent traffic light systems and real-time bus passenger information screens.
 
>We have not hosted anything of this scale in Dorset before so this summer will be 'business as unusual'. I'd urge everyone to plan their travel and think about their journeys in advance.

Commenting on the preparations so far, Justine Greening said:

>Having seen all of the hard work being carried out first hand, I am confident that no effort is being spared to get everyone where they need to be.

>But no doubt a lot of hard work remains ahead of us in order to deliver what will be a fantastic Olympic and Paralympic Games.

She will take up post on 1 June.

Beverley has been Acting Senior Traffic Commissioner since Philip Brown's retirement last October, and becomes only the second Senior Traffic Commissioner appointed following the changes in the Local Transport Act 2008 that gave the post-holder new responsibilities to determine how the traffic commissioners perform their statutory functions.

## Notes to Editors

1. The Traffic Commissioners are appointed by the Secretary of State as statutorily independent Licensing Authorities responsible for bus, coach and goods vehicle operators and for local bus service registrations. They can also take disciplinary action against the licence of bus, coach and lorry drivers who commit road and certain other offences.

2 The role of Senior Traffic Commissioner gives the post-holder important responsibilities to determine how the Traffic Commissioners perform their statutory functions. For example:

  * Determining which statutory functions each Traffic Commissioner works on. This could allow Traffic Commissioners to specialise in particular areas - for example, goods vehicle operator licensing or local bus service registrations;
  * Issuing general directions and guidance to the Traffic Commissioners and Deputy Traffic Commissioners. Directions cover administrative matters such as how to apply for an operators' licence. Guidance covers judicial matters such as how to interpret legislation.

3. The policy and legislation on local bus service registrations are devolved in Scotland. The powers of the Senior Traffic Commissioner do not extend to bus service registrations in Scotland.

Designation of the line between Barrow-in-Furness to Carnforth and on to Lancaster will enable train companies to work more closely with the Furness Line Community Rail Partnership to better design services to meet local needs.

Rail Minister Theresa Villiers said:

>I want to encourage communities to become more closely involved with their railways to help create the services and stations passengers deserve.

>That's why I am delighted to announce this latest community rail service designation. Today's designation is a major step towards helping the Furness Line Community Rail Partnership work closely with local groups to provide innovative and more cost effective rail services for their community.

Nick Donovan, Chief Executive of First TransPennine Express, commented:

>This service designation is a first for a line on which our trains run and I welcome the even closer links between this company and the Furness Line Community Rail Partnership. Our team work last year already resulted in a major prize at the Community Rail awards and I'm sure that even more success can be achieved.

Ian Bevan, Managing Director of Northern Rail, which also runs services on the route, said:

>The designation of the Furness Line is fantastic news for the local community. As this route is integral to the area, its designation ensures it will be developed to benefit local people and visitors to the region. We look forward to working with the community rail partnership to enable the route to prosper as much as possible.

Rob Terwey, Chairman of the Furness Line Community Rail Partnership said:

>Community Rail Service Designation for the Furness Line will help us to achieve even more for passengers on our line. We look forward to having greater flexibility and the opportunity to work more closely with the rail industry, users, local councils and others to maximise the benefit of rail services and station improvements around the shores of Morecambe Bay.

## Notes for Editors

1. The Community Rail Development Strategy looks at innovative ways of operating local branch lines, through a programme of cost management, a drive to increase passenger numbers and direct community involvement via local authorities, community rail partnerships, and other stakeholder groups.

2. To date, 18 lines with their services have been designated as Community Rail lines:

  * St Ives Bay Line: St Erth to St Ives June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.
  * Abbey Line: St Albans Abbey to Watford Junction June 2005. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.

3. Additionally, 13 services have been designated as community rail services whilst not designating the lines on which they run. These services are designated when there are reasons why the infrastructure cannot be included in the designation - because it carries non local traffic or heavy freight or has previously been designated as part of the Trans European Network. To date the following services have been designated:

  * Poacher Line: Grantham to Skegness July 2006. Selected as one of the six pilot projects.

This programme aims to increase the quality and efficiency of the national network, offering a better service to motorists and business users.

Central to the plan will be a 20 year strategy for the national road network and new challenging performance targets for the Highways Agency to deliver against.

Views of all users, whether motorist or business, will be central to developing both the performance specification and the strategy - which will be published for consultation towards the end of this year.

The study was commissioned by the Prime Minister in March and is intended to increase efficiencies and make the money that the motorist already pays go further.

Justine Greening said:

>Our motorways and major A roads are the backbone of Britain, getting people to and from work, powering the economy and keeping families connected. It is vital that we start taking positive steps now to improve how we operate, maintain and enhance our major roads.

>My goal is to transform the Highways Agency in to a best in class organisation. That's why I have agreed to many of the actions Alan Cook recommends. This paves the way for a more efficient, business like and commercially focussed operator, which crucially does much more to listen and respond to the needs of road users.

>Together with the terms of reference for the feasibility study, this constitutes an ambitious integrated programme for reforming the road network in both the short and long term.

In her response to Cook the Transport Secretary also pledged:

  * A much smarter approach to planning through the production of route based strategies. These documents will identify what needs to be delivered on key routes, including any improvements, to achieve the outcomes set in the performance specification. They will support a much greater local and regional stakeholder involvement in planning for the network and help to inform our investment decisions for the next spending review.
  * To work closely with the Highways Agency and HM Treasury to consider how greater funding certainty and flexibility can be introduced for the strategic road network.

This programme of immediate work will start to address challenges set in the Cook review, bringing improvements in the short to medium term. These reforms are also an essential stepping stone to any more radical reforms we may introduce following the feasibility study being undertaken with HM Treasury.

The feasibility study will explore a range options to increase private sector involvement and investment in our roads. This will also examine how these options would be financed and how they interact with existing motoring taxation, but will not consider road pricing. It will also determine the role of tolling in the provision of new infrastructure, but it will not consider tolling existing capacity. The study will provide a report to the Prime Minister in autumn 2012.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120522a,Revised charges to improve Dartford Crossing,Plans to tackle congestion and deliver improvements at the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing have taken an important step forward today.,"Plans to tackle congestion and deliver future improvements at the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing have taken an important step forward as Road Minister Mike Penning today announced changes to the Crossing charges.

The change to the charges will help deliver a package of extensive improvements. The Minister re-affirmed the Government's commitment to introduce free-flow charging to tackle congestion and improve journey times at the Crossing. He also confirmed work continues on analysing the options for a new Lower Thames crossing, following the commitment made in the Autumn Statement.

The Minister also announced that the Department for Transport will carry out a full review of the Local Residents' Discount Scheme to consider how this can be improved and take-up increased. He will be inviting local MPs to a meeting to discuss this shortly.

From October 2012, cash charges for car users will increase by 50 pence, with proportionate increases for other vehicles. The Crossing will remain free for motorcyclists, and discounts for local residents and drivers who pay in advance will continue. Funding from the charge increase will help to pay for free-flow electronic charging - a vital time-saving device that will benefit the millions of motorists that use the Crossing every year.

Road Minister Mike Penning said: 

>The Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing is a vital piece of transport infrastructure that has brought huge economic benefits to the country. But currently it can't meet the growing demands of drivers so we need to plan properly for the longer term. 

>That's why we've given a commitment not only to introduce free-flow charging by the autumn 2014 but also to build a new crossing in the Lower Thames area. We have also listened carefully to what people have said about our proposals on charging, which is why charges will not increase until later this year. The proceeds will help us prioritise investment for much-needed improvements to capacity and journey times.

The Department has published its formal response to the consultation on proposals to revise the road user charging regime at the Crossing. This is part of a package of improvements to develop its performance in the short, medium and longer-term.

As part of the changes, discounts for those paying the crossing charge in advance through the electronic Dart-Tag system will remain. The enhanced discounts provided to local residents will also be retained with no changes to the levels of charges.

In October 2012 the level of cash payments at the Crossing will increase from £1.50 to £2.00 for cars, from £2.00 to £2.50 for 2 axle goods vehicles, and from £3.70 to £5.00 for heavy goods vehicles. A second increase will be made at the point that free-flow charging is introduced - currently forecast as October 2014 - to £2.50 for cars, £3.00 for 2 axle vehicles and £6.00 for heavy goods vehicles.

The Department has published its formal response to the [crossing charges consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-08).

## Notes to editors

1. A road user charge has been collected at the Crossing since 2003 using powers in the Transport Act 2000 with the purpose of managing the high demand for use of the Crossing. The Transport Act 2000 also provides that revenues from a road user charge must be spent on transport.

2. The current charges have been in place since November 2008, which was the first time they were revised since their introduction as a road user charge in 2003. They are set out in the A282 Trunk Road (Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Charging Scheme) Order 2008 (Statutory Instrument 2008/1951).

3. Changes to some elements of the charging regime require the making of a new charging order in accordance with the procedural requirements set out in Trunk Road Charging Schemes (Bridges and Tunnels)(England) Procedure Regulations 2001 (Statutory Instrument 2001/2303).

4. The revised charge rates are set out in the table below:

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120521a,Cutting MOT red tape for classic vehicle owners,Announcement by Roads Minister Mike Penning about how classic vehicles will be exempted from the MoT test.,"Classic vehicles will be exempted from the MoT test, Roads Minister Mike Penning announced today.

Classic and historic vehicles are often very well maintained by their owners and have a much lower accident and MoT failure rate than newer vehicles.

The current requirement to undergo an MoT test goes over and above the obligations set out in European legislation. Following a [public consultation which showed high levels of support](/consultations/dft-2011-27/) for the proposals, vehicles manufactured before 1960 will be exempted from the MoT test from 18th November 2012 reducing costs for owners.

Owners of affected vehicles will still be able to take exempt vehicles for an MoT test on a voluntary basis.

Mike Penning said:

>We are committed to cutting out red tape which costs motorists money without providing significant overall benefits. Owners of classic cars and motorbikes tend to be enthusiasts who maintain their vehicles well - they don't need to be told to look after them, they're out there in all weathers checking the condition of the engine, tyres and bodywork.

>Owners of classic vehicles will still be legally required to ensure that they are safe and in a proper condition to be on the road but scrapping the MoT test for these vehicles will save motorists money.

The [response to the consultation is available](/consultations/dft-2011-27/). 

## Notes to Editors

  1. Pre-1960 licensed vehicles make up about 0.6% of the total number of licensed vehicles in Great Britain, but are involved in just 0.03% of road casualties and accidents.
  2. Evidence shows that the initial MoT test failure rate declines by the age of vehicle after the vehicle is 13 years old.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dsa-press-20120515,Highway Code app launched to improve road safety,"The Highway Code is undergoing a digital revolution as Transport Secretary, Justine Greening, launches it as an interactive app for smartphones.","One of Britain's most iconic publications is undergoing a digital revolution today as Transport Secretary, Justine Greening, marks the Highway Code's 81st year by launching it as an interactive app for smartphones.

The best-seller's technological transformation will make it even easier - and more fun - for road users to keep up to date with the rules of the road. 

Much of the Highway Code's content has changed considerably since its launch in 1931. For example mirrors were not even mentioned in the first edition and drivers were advised to sound their horn when overtaking.

How road users access its content has also moved with the times. It is already free to read online, can be downloaded as an ebook and there are also [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HighwayCodeGB) and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/HighwayCodeGB) accounts offering regular topical reminders.

Now a new app for the iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch will make it even easier to keep up to date with the rules of the road through a more intuitive, interactive format.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>With more and more of us using smartphones and other devices it's vital that products like the Highway Code adapt to be as accessible as possible.

>The app makes it easier for everyone to keep their knowledge up to date and is a great example of how new technology can help to improve road safety.

>The Highway Code has been helping to save lives for more than 80 years and, with innovations like this, I am confident it will do so for many more to come.

The new app includes the complete contents of the Highway Code with a search facility making it easy to find rules and information. There are also interactive features like quizzes, a stopping distance calculator and a tool to help users identify road signs. 

The Official Highway Code app is available on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/official-highway-code/id522687241?mt=8) for £3.99. For other official Highway Code publications see [tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?FO=1207776](http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?FO=1207776).

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120509a,Government crack down on drug driving menace,The Government has announced plans to crack down on those who drive while under the influence of drugs.,"The Government announced plans today to crack down on those who drive while under the influence of drugs.

Legislation unveiled in the Queen's Speech will create a specific drug driving offence. Currently police have to demonstrate that driving had been impaired by drugs in order to prosecute.

Under the proposed legislation it will automatically be an offence to drive a motor vehicle if you have certain controlled drugs in your body in excess of specified limits. This will make it much easier for police to take action against drug drivers.

Devices to screen for drugs in the body are expected to receive type approval from the Home Office by the end of the year.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>Drug drivers are a deadly menace - they must be stopped and that is exactly what I intend to do.

>The new offence sends out a clear message that if you drive whilst under the influence of drugs you will not get away with it.

>We have an enviable record on road safety in this country and I want to keep it that way. This measure will help to rid our roads of the irresponsible minority who risk the lives of innocent motorists and pedestrians.

An independent review of drink and drug driving law in 2010 recommended that a new specified limit offence should be developed. The exact drugs covered by the offence and the specified limits for each will be determined following advice from an expert panel and a public consultation.

Earlier this year the Department for Transport announced the formation of the panel and today is confirming the membership. It includes experts in the field of alcohol and drug misuse and will also work with officials from the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Department of Health.

The penalty for the new offence will be a maximum of 6 months imprisonment and/or a fine of up to £5,000, and an automatic driving ban of at least 12 months.

### Notes to editors:

  1. A Government review of drink and drug driving law recommended that the new offence should be developed.
  2. The clause introduces an offence across Great Britain of driving or being in charge of a motor vehicle whilst having certain controlled drugs in the blood or urine in excess of the level specified for each of those drugs.
  3. It is already an offence to drive whilst impaired by drugs, and this will remain in place alongside the new specified limit offence. The penalty for the new offence will be a maximum of 6 months imprisonment, and/or a fine of up to £5,000, and an automatic driving ban of at least 12 months.
  4. The clause introduces a regulation-making power to specify which controlled drugs and what levels of them are included in the new offence. These drugs and levels will be specified following advice from an expert panel, a public consultation and using affirmative resolution procedure.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120508a,Work starts on six road schemes for future delivery,Work supporting improvements to the strategic road network has been given the go ahead today.,"Work to support future improvements to the strategic road network has been given the green light today. Roads Minister Mike Penning announced that development work will start on six major road schemes.

The development work - to be carried out over the next three years - will ensure that a 'pipeline' of future Highways Agency major infrastructure improvements will be maintained, contributing to future economic growth, and supporting Government's National Infrastructure Plan. By developing these now, proposals will be in a good position to be considered for delivery in the early years of the next spending review period (post 2015).

The six schemes are:

  * M4 Junctions 3-12 managed motorway scheme; Thames Valley
  * M25 Junction 30 / A13 congestion relief scheme, Thurrock;
  * A19/A1058 Coast Road Junction improvement; North Tyneside
  * A21 Tonbridge - Pembury widening; Kent
  * A63 Castle Street improvements, Hull; and
  * A160/A180 improvements, Immingham

Roads Minister Mike Penning said:

>We are committed to tackling congestion, keeping traffic moving and supporting the UK economy, putting in money where it's most needed and where the public will get a good return on investment.
 
>We have already announced around £3bn of investment to complete work on Highways Agency major road projects under construction and to allow work to start before March 2015 on 20 much-needed road improvement schemes.
 
>Today, I am confirming development work will be advanced on a further six schemes around the country. This means they will be in a good position to be selected for start of works in the early years of the next spending review period.

The development work will focus on designing and consulting on proposals, along with progressing any necessary statutory processes.

Today's announcement also marks the conclusion of a review process for four schemes - including the M4 J3-12 managed motorway scheme - from the 2010 Spending Review.

The M3 Junctions 2-4a managed motorway scheme has already been added to the roads programme with a start of work date of 2013/14.

The two remaining proposals, the M20 Junction 10a and M54 to M6/M6 Toll link road, will continue to be considered for future delivery along with other schemes.

Those proposals not selected at this time to have their development work advanced are still good schemes that address clear problems, and the Department will continue to work with key stakeholders to drive down costs and maximise public value for money.

### Notes to editors

  1. Schemes were assessed according to their economic case (Benefit Cost Ratio), how well they fit strategically with the needs of the network and the economy, and their readiness for construction. Advancing the development work of the six schemes does not guarantee that they will be funded; decisions about which schemes will enter the programme in the next period will be taken at the next spending review.
  2. The investment to develop the schemes will come from efficiencies achieved by the Highways Agency in delivering improvements to major roads that are in the current roads programme.
  3. The Highways Agency will be working through the optimum programme and final costs for the development of each scheme shortly and further announcements on next steps for each scheme will be made in due course.
  4. In addition to the six schemes selected to have their development work funded, the Highways Agency are continuing to develop the A5 - M1 Link Road (Dunstable Northern Bypass) following the Government having secured £45 million private sector investment towards the scheme.
  5. For an up to date list of schemes in the Highways Agency's roads programme, for schemes under construction or starting construction during this spending review period (April 2010 to March 2015), visit the [Agency's website](http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/29356.aspx)",5/8/2012,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,

The new 4 mile stretch of road will run from the A6003 near Barford Bridge (north-west of Kettering) to the Stanion roundabout at the A43/A6116 junction. The scheme will unlock significant economic growth potential in the northern part of Northamptonshire and improve access in and around Corby. It will also divert traffic away from the rural villages of Great and Little Oakley, Newton and the conservation village of Geddington who currently suffer from heavy through traffic on the existing A43.

Norman Baker said:

>This road will play a key role in helping to maximise regeneration and growth in Corby and surrounding areas which are expecting a large growth in population over the next decade. It will greatly improve connections between the growth towns in the area as well as bringing much needed relief to nearby rural villages.

>That is why we putting in £20.6m into this scheme as part of this government's commitment to drive growth in the economy and reduce congestion on our roads.

The scheme was one of 20 given initial approval in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement at the end of last year. Work can now start on the main construction with the road scheduled to open in January 2014.

### Notes to Editors:

  1. Today's announcement grant Full (final) approval to the A43 Corby Link Road scheme enabling work to begin.
  2. The new road is scheduled to open in January 2014.
  3. The Department will provide a maximum of £20.6m towards the full scheme cost of £34m.
  4. The scheme consists of a four mile (6.5km) dual carriageway running from the A6003 near Barford Bridge (north-west of Kettering) to the Stanion roundabout at the A43/A6116 junction. On completion, the Corby Link Road will become the new alignment for the A43.
  5. The route includes a four leg roundabout at its southern end (A6003), running north-eastwards, parallel with the Kettering-Corby railway for some 2.5 miles (4km) and linking in with the A43 north of Geddington village at its junction with the A6116 at Stanion.
  6. To minimise the impact of traffic on local communities the road has been designed without intermediate junctions.

The Kingskerswell Bypass, worth £109.2m, will see over three miles of dual carriageway linking Newton Abbott and Torbay and a flyover section at Penn Inn, bringing both economic and environmental benefits to the local area.

Justine Greening said:

>The Department for Transport has invested over £76m in this scheme, which will cut congestion on Devon's roads, as well as benefiting the environment and the local economy.

>This bypass will provide an alternative to driving through the middle of the village which currently sees very heavy traffic, particularly over busy holiday periods.

>The people of Kingskerswell will no longer have to put up with endless traffic jams, exhaust fumes and trucks thundering through the village and the road will really open up Torbay for tourism, creating jobs while providing a more pleasant drive for locals and visitors alike.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said:

>The Government is determined to make Britain's infrastructure fit for the 21st century, helping to rebalance the economy and drive growth in all regions of the UK.

>I am delighted to approve this funding to deliver the Kingskerswell Bypass, which is critical to growth in the Newton Abbott and Torbay areas.

The road is expected to cut the daily flow of traffic through the village by more than 90% and deliver significant improvements to local air quality.

The Kingskerswell Bypass was one of 20 schemes given initial approval in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement last year. Preliminary work will start later this month, with the main construction phase set to begin in the autumn. Work will be completed in December 2015.

### Notes to editors

  1. Today's announcement grants Full (final) Approval to the Kingskerswell Bypass major public transport scheme.
  2. The Department will provide £76.39m towards the scheme.
  3. The scheme comprises a new 3.4 mile dual carriageway on route from Newton Abbot to Torbay. The key components are the Penn Inn flyover near Newton Abbot, dualling of the existing road to the North of Kingskerswell and a new dualled road bypassing the centre of Kingskerswell passing to the west of the main body of the village.

The leases on the existing driving test centres in Arbroath and Forfar expire this month, and testing was originally expected to move to the test centre in Dundee. However, the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) has reached an agreement to provide tests from the Asda supermarkets in Arbroath and Forfar, ensuring that candidates will continue to benefit from a convenient, local service. 

The agreement in Arbroath and Forfar reflects a wider strategy to offer more local services for driving test candidates. In areas without a local test centre where there is sufficient demand for tests, DSA is looking at offering tests from alternative premises such as local authority buildings or retail outlets. 

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said: 

>I am delighted that we can continue to provide a local service for driving test candidates in Angus. We have worked very closely with the MP for Angus, Mike Weir, and with the local community on this.

>I want us to be more flexible and innovative in delivering driving tests to make sure that we are offering people the best service possible wherever they live. Our aim is to offer a local service that is convenient for candidates as well as being cost effective.

Robert Hallyburton, store manager at Asda Forfar, said:

>We are delighted to be able to support this strategy, which gives space for candidates to carry out their driving tests in their local area.

>Hopefully we will see many people pass with flying colours.

Testing will be conducted from the Asda supermarket in Forfar from 15 May, and in Arbroath from 28 May.

Drivers can also give temporary passwords to prospective or current employers, allowing them to confirm how much training drivers have completed.

DSA's chief executive, Rosemary Thew, said:

>Driver CPC has been developed to raise and maintain the knowledge and skills of lorry, bus and coach drivers. 

>The new online driver enquiry service will allow professional drivers to check that their training has been uploaded and allow employers to see that this crucial training is taking place - helping the passenger transport and road haulage industries to maintain high professional standards.

The service provides a 'one stop shop' to access clear, simple and up to date information. The enquiry screen shows:

  * Driver CPC qualification expiry date (bus and coach and/or lorry)
  * details of each training course completed

The online driver enquiry service can be accessed 24 hours-a-day via [direct.gov.uk/checkdrivercpc](http://www.direct.gov.uk/checkdrivercpc).

The former driving test centre in Southend closed in 2008 when a new test centre opened in Basildon, but from 14 May DSA will begin testing from the Tickfield Community Centre on Southend's Tickfield Industrial Estate.

The move is part of a strategy to offer a more local service for driving test candidates. In areas without a local test centre where there is sufficient demand for tests, DSA is looking at offering tests on a part time basis from flexible premises such as community centres and other local authority buildings. 

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said: 

>I am delighted that driving tests will be returning to Southend and we have worked very closely with the local community on this.

>I want us to be more flexible and innovative in delivering driving tests to make sure that we are offering people the best service possible wherever they live. Our aim is to offer a local service that is convenient for candidates as well as being cost effective.

The Pothole Review - part of the Coalition Government's £6m Highways Maintenance Efficiency Programme - looks at how best to fix potholes once they have formed but also how to prevent them from appearing in the first place. The recommendations for Central Government, local highway authorities and the highways sector fall into three main themes:

  * Prevention is better than cure - intervening at the right time will reduce the amount of potholes forming and prevent bigger problems later.
  * Right First Time - do it once and get it right, rather than face continuous bills.
  * Clarity for the public - local highway authorities need to communicate to the public what is being done and how it is being done.

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>We all know the misery that potholes can cause to highway users and local communities and the recent series of harsh winters has only served to intensify the situation.
 
>We've given £3 billion to councils for road maintenance over the next four years but money can only go so far and the old adage rings true: prevention is indeed better than cure.
 
>I would urge all those involved with highways maintenance, including councillors, chief executives, local highway practitioners, those in the utility sector and contractors to adopt the approaches set out in this report, not only to make real cost savings but also to provide a high quality service that both the road user and local residents deserve.

Today's Review investigates the issue of potholes from an engineering perspective plus explores the wider issues around potholes, including public expectations, the impact of long term maintenance strategies, decision making arrangements, the processes of reporting, prioritising and repairing, guidance and wider operational arrangements within local highways authorities.

Matthew Lugg, President of the Association of Directors of Economy, Environment, Planning and Transport, who led the Pothole Review, said:

>This Review has focused on key principles and strategies to reduce potholes in the future. There are a number of key recommendations, which when implemented by the highway sector will lead to more effective outcomes for the highway users and the economy. I would encourage all parties to take on board the recommendations. I am thankful for the help and assistance that was provided by colleagues from both the public and private sector including key stakeholder organisations.

  3. The Pothole Review has been carried out by the HMEP, which is a sector-led transformation programme to maximise returns from highways investment and deliver efficient and effective highway maintenance services. The programme is sponsored by the Department for Transport who is providing £6m funding to provide the tools and opportunities to help the sector build on existing good practice and collaboration between public and private partners.
  4. The key themes promoted by the programme are greater collaboration, adoption of asset management principles, benchmarking & performance and procurement, contracting and standardisation. HMEP will provide practical guidance on efficiencies that will be of interest to local authorities, supplier organisations and representative bodies: [http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/local-authorities/hmep/](/topics/local-authorities/hmep/)",4/10/2012,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,improving-local-transport,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--30,

The improvements work, worth £10m, will mean that four of the roundabouts along the A164 will have capacity improvements and a section of the A164 will also be dualled. There will also be a continuous footway/cycleway between Humber Bridge and Beverley.

It is hoped that the scheme will help tackle the traffic congestion on the A164 and provide more reliable journey times, as well as providing better and more reliable access to the International Hub and Humber Ports Complex and other areas and communities along the A164 route corridor.

Justine Greening said:

>This is a massively important road in East Riding and these improvements are going to make a big difference to local people and businesses.

>Investment like this shows just how determined this Government is to tackle the congestion on our roads which holds motorists up every day. It is good for the environment and good for jobs and growth too.

The scheme was one of 20 given initial approval in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement last year. Work can now start on the main construction works, with the road scheduled to open in March 2013.

The scheme - the fifth in the country - will give six Yorkshire councils more powers to coordinate road works and take tough action when they overrun. The councils included in the scheme are Barnsley, Doncaster, Kirklees, Leeds, Rotherham and Sheffield. The scheme will allow the councils to require anyone carrying out road works to apply for a permit in advance and to set conditions on timing, coordination or the amount of road space to be left available to road users during the works. Those companies who break the terms of their permit or work without a permit will have to pay a fine.

Norman Baker said:

>I am delighted to be able to give the go ahead for the Yorkshire permit scheme.

>Although we all know that road works are sometimes unavoidable, the disruption they cause can be a hugely frustrating for drivers, cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians as well as costing businesses time and money. That is why it is important that councils use the powers they have to make sure utility firms carry out works with consideration for those who use the road. 

>We are determined to tackle problem road works and make sure that those who dig up the road are made accountable when disruption occurs.

The Yorkshire permit scheme is the fifth permit scheme to gain approval. Kent County Council, Northamptonshire County Council, London councils and St Helens have had their schemes approved in the last two years. These councils will be monitoring their schemes to make sure that they are producing benefits for local residents and feeding this information back to the Department for Transport.

### Notes to Editors

  1. The six Yorkshire councils are the first English local authorities in the North to have their applications for a street works permit scheme approved by the Government as meeting the requirements of the Traffic Management Act 2004 and The Traffic Management Permit Scheme (England) Regulations 2007. 
  2. The six Yorkshire councils have been asked to nominate the preferred date for their permit schemes to come into effect. DfT officials will work with the Council to give effect to the scheme on that date, by means of a Statutory Instrument. 
  3. A council running a permit scheme is able to charge companies for providing a permit although any charge should cover costs and should not result in a surplus. It will be a criminal offence to work without a permit. The maximum fine will be £5,000. It will be an offence to not meet a permit condition, for which the maximum fine is £2,500. Fixed Penalty Notices, as an alternative enforcement mechanism, can also be given for working without a permit or not meeting a permit condition. Councils in England have been able to apply to the Department for Transport to run their own street works permit schemes since the relevant Regulations came into force in April 2008. 
  4. The six Yorkshire councils are responsible for the details of its scheme, and the timetable for its introduction.
  5. Permit schemes are already in place in Kent, London and Northamptonshire.

The Transport for London scheme - the first of its kind in Britain - will start in June. TfL will be able to charge utility companies up to £2,500 a day to dig up the busiest roads during peak times when road works cause the most disruption.

This will incentivise utility firms to carry out their works more quickly and at times when roads are quieter. Companies would be able to avoid the charges by carrying out works during less busy periods or, if appropriate, at night.

Justine Greening said:

>Anyone who has travelled on London's roads knows how frustrating it is to find major routes being dug up in the middle of the rush hour or - even worse - lanes coned off when no one is even carrying out any work.

>It's not just inconvenient but expensive, costing the economy £4 billion a year.

>I'm pleased the Mayor and TfL have got cracking in bringing forward proposals for a lane rental scheme which will bring real benefits to those travelling in the capital.

In order to gather evidence on the effectiveness of lane rental, the Department for Transport has proposed that there should be up to three pioneer areas and is inviting applications from two more interested local authorities. Successful pioneer areas will need to have exhausted other options, including using a permit scheme and their lane rental schemes will have to be evaluated annually.

The guidance which accompanies the new powers makes it clear that lane rental charges must be avoidable and proportionate to the costs of congestion. Any revenue raised from the implementation of lane rental charges will have to be used to fund measures which could help to reduce future road works disruption. This could include infrastructure work, research or measures to improve the management of works.

### Notes to Editors

  1. The primary legislation (section 74A of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991) provides the necessary powers for local highway authorities to put in place lane rental schemes, subject (in England) to the approval of the Secretary of State, and allows Regulations to make further provision about such schemes.

The refurbished test centre will provide candidates with better facilities and a more pleasant environment, as well as being more energy efficient. 

The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) test centre was forced to close during the severe weather conditions of winter 2010 when water from a burst pipe caused extensive damage. As the test centre was due for refurbishment, DSA took the opportunity to improve facilities at the Bury test centre at the same time as carrying out repairs to the building.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>It is excellent news that the driving test centre in Bury is re-opening. This is an important service for the local community and I am pleased that candidates in Bury will now be able to take their test at a convenient location that provides an excellent level of service.

DSA's regional operations manager, Mark Winn, said:

>We have carried out works to minimise the risk of repeat flooding and redecorated the test centre, as well as improving heating to the customer waiting area. The test centre now provides a much more pleasant environment for both staff and customers.

Improvements to the building have also made the test centre more energy efficient with better insulation, double glazing and motion sensitive lighting.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120313a,Tougher penalties for road works disruption,Utility companies who take too long to complete their road works will face higher charges Norman Baker has announced.,"Utility companies who take too long to complete their road works will face higher charges, Transport Minister Norman Baker announced today.

All utility companies who dig up the road must agree a time frame for their works with the local council. If a firm overstays this period and has not negotiated the additional time with the local council then they face an 'overrun charge' for each additional day they spend on the road.

Currently, the maximum daily overrun charge is £2,500, depending on the type of works and the sort of street being occupied. From 1st October 2012 this will rise on the busiest roads to £5,000 a day for the first three extra days, rising to £10,000 a day from the fourth extra day onward. Councils must spend overrun charge income on implementing transport policies.

Norman Baker said:

>We know that utility firms need to dig up the road to maintain the infrastructure we all rely upon but sometimes this work takes far too long to complete, causing disruption and frustration for everyone using the road.

>Increasing these charges means that utilities will pay penalties which reflect the cost of the disruption suffered when works go on longer than they should.

>The increases will also provide an incentive for utilities to finish works on time and prevent people sitting in unnecessary traffic jams in the first place.

The Department is also changing the way overrun charges are structured to reflect the fact that all overruns cause the same level of disruption regardless of how long the work was originally planned for.

The Government's response to the consultation on overrun charges can be found here: [www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2010-13](/consultations/dft-2010-13). Regulations will be laid in Parliament shortly and are due to come in to force in October 2012.

The Government has also recently put forward proposals for councils to use lane rental schemes which would see utilities pay a daily charge to do works on the busiest roads as well as measures to reduce bureaucracy for councils wanting to implement road works permit schemes. Both consultations can be found on the Department's website.

### Notes to Editors

  1. The legislation which allows overrun charges to be levied by local authorities is the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, s.74. New regulations will be required to effect these changes and these will be laid shortly.
  2. Chapter 10 of the Co-ordination Code of Practice will be updated to reflect the change in charges.
  3. Local authorities can use their discretion and do not have to charge the maximum charge in all circumstances.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120307a,"New cycle routes, racks and repair centres get England moving",Cyclists and walkers from across the UK are on track to benefit from thousands of new cycle spaces and routes.,"Cyclists and walkers from across the UK are on track to benefit from thousands of new cycle spaces and routes from the middle of this year, Transport Minister Norman Baker has announced.

Over 7,500 new cycle spaces at railway stations and 38 new and improved routes have been agreed, as part of a £30 million package of developments to connect communities, reduce carbon emissions, get people active and make cycling safer and more convenient. The schemes will also promote economic growth by providing commuters with improved sustainable travel options.

The Department for Transport has worked closely with the Association of Train Operating Companies, UK transport charity Sustrans, the Cycle Rail Working Group and local councils to design and approve the [68 projects to provide better access for cyclists and pedestrians](/publications/linking-places-fund).

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>I know these plans will be hugely beneficial to communities and cyclists up and down England. They will also help to create jobs and reduce our carbon footprints while making cycling safer and more convenient - further emphasising the government's dedication to offer sustainable transport for all.

>I look forward to visiting some of the projects and hearing the difference renewed transport links have made to peoples' daily lives, especially making that last mile from the train to home an easy ride or walk.

The projects are spread across the England and focus on areas that will enhance existing transport links. The plans include the development of paths that will allow budding cyclists to travel directly and safely to their destination - their bikes will be secure on arrival with new cycle racks, the use of CCTV and additional lighting.

Malcolm Shepherd, Sustrans' Chief Executive, said:

>Sustrans is delighted to be working with the Department for Transport to help more people in communities to walk or cycle to school and work.

>Ongoing investment is needed to give many more people the chance to get active safely in their everyday journeys.

At Cambridge train station, a 'cycle hub' will be created offering cycle storage for up to 3,000 bikes - making it one of the largest in the UK. Commuters will also be able to hire bikes, purchase new cycles while also checking your bicycle into the 'bike doctor' for a full MOT.

Speaking on behalf of the Cycle Rail Working Group, Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies said:

>Train companies and the rail industry as a whole recognise the important role cycling plays in our growing railway and the Cycle Rail Working Group has been working hard on how we can improve cycle-rail provision further.

>This money is a real boost to the group's work and is good news for passengers. It will allow the industry to extend and develop cycling facilities across the country, offering more people a low-cost and environmentally friendly way to get to and from the station.

The funding complements £7 million that Network Rail is investing to improve cycle facilities across the country. This is going towards updating and creating new facilities at stations up and down the network, and includes £1.5 million for cycle hubs at Liverpool Lime Street, Sheffield, London Victoria and London Waterloo.

Including match funding from local authorities, train operators and private investors, the projects will collectively deliver over £37 million worth of improvements. The Department's contribution of £15 million, announced last month, is in addition to the £560 million Local Sustainable Transport Fund.

The new interchange will improve safety and security for bus passengers and will link directly with the new Metrolink extension currently under construction.

The interchange will be on the site adjacent to the existing bus station and next to the new Council offices currently under construction. It will replace the current 1970s bus station under the multi-storey car park. The site of the existing station will now be redeveloped as part of the wider £250m town centre redevelopment plans.

Norman Baker said:

>I am in no doubt that this new station will encourage more people to travel by bus in and around Rochdale which is why we're putting nearly £7m into this impressive scheme which will support growth and cut carbon.

>Having visited the bus station, it was clear to me that action had to be taken. The new station will be a significant improvement on the current facilities - the dark and dingy atmosphere is not the welcome you want when you arrive into town - and will also allow redevelopment of the existing site which will bring some 1,500 new jobs into the town.

Councillor Andrew Fender, Chair of the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee, said:

>The Rochdale Interchange will be a distinctive new landmark, and along with the Metrolink extension is crucial to the wider regeneration of Rochdale town centre.

>The Interchange will give Rochdale the brighter, safer and more modern transport facilities the town deserves - and it will be greener too, as the innovative hydropower scheme we've installed nearby provides the Interchange with an environmentally-friendly energy source, reducing its carbon footprint.

The Rochdale Interchange was one of 20 schemes given initial approval in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement at the end of the last year. This is the first of those schemes to reach final approval, which means that all statutory powers have been sought and contracts approved. Work can now start on the main construction works with the new bus station scheduled to open in summer 2013.

### Notes to editors

  1. Today's announcement grants Full (final) Approval to the Rochdale Interchange scheme enabling work to begin.
  2. The new interchange is scheduled to open in summer 2013 with the adjacent Metrolink terminus opening in 2014.
  3. The Department will provide £6.972m towards the full scheme cost of £11.5m.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120221,Cash boost for electric van man,"Van buyers will be able to receive 20% - up to £8,000 - off the cost of this first wave of 7 plug-in vans.","The first vans eligible for the Government's new Plug-in Van Grant, have been announced by Transport Secretary Justine Greening and Business Minister Mark Prisk today.

Van buyers will be able to receive 20% - up to £8,000 - off the cost of this first wave of 7 plug-in vans.

At an event today to launch the eligible vans, which was supported by companies such as British Gas and BT as well as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Justine Greening said:

>Our new grant demonstrates that you can be a motorist and still be pro-environment.

>Cars and vans are absolutely central to people's lives - it's how most of us get around and for many journeys they are, and will remain, the only practical and convenient travel choice. Nevertheless climate change is a global challenge we simply have to meet head on. It cannot be ignored or side-stepped.

>The new Plug-in Van Grant - offering up to £8,000 off one of these seven innovative vans - also makes business sense as it's been estimated that a small electric van will typically cost £100 less in fuel for every thousand miles driven compared to a diesel equivalent.

The way that vans are used and driven make them ideally suited to the switch to electric as they often have a predictable route and distance to travel each day; they make frequent stops; and many of them return to an overnight base where they can be easily recharged.

Business Minister Mark Prisk said:

>Vans are essential to the smooth running of so many businesses and contribute enormously to the UK economy. An upfront purchase grant, when combined with lower running costs and tax benefits, can make switching to an ultra low carbon van an attractive choice for those businesses.

>Now there are seven different models eligible for that support van buyers should be able to choose one they find easy on the eye as well as on the wallet.""

Businesses that run electric vans can benefit from reduced refuelling costs, are exempt from the van benefit charge, attract capital allowance concessions, and also receive a 100% discount for the congestion charge in the London.

The Chief Executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Paul Everitt said:

>The Plug-In Van Grant and today's detail on the 7 models eligible is excellent news for van drivers, operators, businesses and the industry. The savings on the initial purchase price, coupled with the tax advantages and very low running costs make a plug-in van an attractive proposition - particularly for those running local and back-to-base services.

>Home to a high level of low carbon R&D and manufacturing activity, the UK is well placed to take full advantage of the ultra-low carbon vehicle sector. Incentives that support the development of a flourishing market will add to our competitive advantage.

The first seven vans to be made eligible for the grants are;

  * Azure Dynamics - Transit Connect Electric
  * Daimler Mercedes-Benz - Vito E-Cell
  * Faam - ECOMILE
  * Faam - JOLLY 2000
  * Mia-electric - Mia U
  * Renault - Kangoo ZE variants Kangoo VAN ZE, Kangoo Van Maxi ZE, and Kangoo Van Maxi Crew ZE
  * Smith Electric - Smith Edison variants SE2 and SE3

Gearoid Lane, Managing Director of British Gas New Markets, who have announced their ambition to have hundreds of electric vans in their fleets over the next few years, said:

>Extending electric car grants to cover fleet vehicles is a positive step in lowering emissions on our roads. With our network of engineers repairing boilers around the country we are keen to include electric vans in our own fleet, with 100s scheduled to be introduced over the next few years. We are also at the forefront of helping people with their own electric cars by installing charge points in homes up and down Britain.

The eligible models are revealed on the same day a report is published by the Climate Group which shows the benefits low carbon vehicles can have if businesses adopt them into their fleets and provides companies with the advice and tools they need to make their good intentions a reality.

Ellen MacArthur, whose charity - the Ellen MacArthur Foundation - already uses an electric van, said:

>We've been running a Renault electric van to help with the work of my Foundation and it is working really well for us. Today's announcement means people will have more choice about the kinds of vans that they can drive and I am pleased to support this initiative.

The Transport Secretary also announced today that the Mia Electric (Mia and Mia L models) has become the eleventh vehicle now eligible for the Plug-in Car Grant - a consumer grant of up to £5,000.

The former driving test centre in Warrington closed in 2008 when a new multi-purpose test centre opened in St Helens, but from 5 March DSA will begin testing on a temporary basis from the Paddington House Hotel on Manchester Road.

Testing at the Paddington House Hotel is initially planned to run until June, and tests are then expected to transfer to Warrington Borough Council's Orford Community Hub on Festival Avenue.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said: 

>I am delighted to announce that driving tests will be returning to Warrington. I want us to be more flexible and innovative in delivering driving tests to make sure that we are offering people the best service possible wherever they live.

>Our aim is to offer a local service that is convenient for candidates as well as being cost effective.

The move to resume testing in Warrington is part of a national trial exploring a new approach to test delivery. As well as using conventional driving test centres, DSA is looking at delivering tests from other sites such as local authority buildings, leisure centres or hotels.

In addition to the trial in Warrington, DSA is currently running trials in seven other locations across the country. The trials are being monitored to assess any impact on levels of customer service and the cost of delivery, as well as making sure the integrity of the test is maintained.

The trials only involve practical car tests; theory test centres are not affected.",2/9/2012,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,making-roads-safer,Driving Standards Agency,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120201,Better service for motorists at garages,Motorists are set for improvements in customer service from garages under a package of transparency and value-for-money measures.,"Motorists are set for improvements in customer service from garages under a package of transparency and value-for-money measures unveiled today by Transport Secretary Justine Greening.

An evaluation of existing MOT test standards and frequency took account of the views and evidence offered by a wide range of organisations.

In particular, it considered data from Department for Transport executive agency VOSA (Vehicle and Operator Services Agency) showing that more than a quarter (27.7%) of vehicles tested in 2010-2011 had one or more car defects that were either missed by MOT test centres or incorrectly assessed.

The VOSA data also showed that the roadworthiness of one-in-eight cars (12.4%) was being incorrectly assessed by MOT test centres.

As a result, the Government will work with industry, motoring organisations and consumer groups to focus on the reliability and standards of garages. The Government has decided to:

  * Retain the existing rules on MOT test frequency since the evidence shows that vehicle defects are being missed and roadworthiness mis-assessed.
  * Shine a light on the performance of MOT testing stations by releasing hitherto unpublished VOSA survey data on whether the sector is complying with test standards. This is published today.
  * Work with motoring organisations to find out what problems motorists experience and enable them to share examples of good customer service - in particular to find ways to make it easier for customers to give feedback on their experiences of garages in a way that others can see - potentially in the manner of existing online hotel and restaurant review websites. 
  * Encourage the take up of industry codes of practice - and expand them to include MOT testing - so that customers can find garages signed up to schemes delivering the highest standards and take action if they have not received the service they expect. 
  * Help motorists to spot ""clocked"" second hand vehicles, by changing MOT certificates so that they carry the last three years' mileage information as well as the mileage on the day of the test, and encourage car buyers to check full MOT histories using the online MOT database.
  * Arrange ""mystery shopper"" tests to help improve performance in addition to those already carried out by VOSA.

Justine Greening said:

>Our garages are crucial to ensuring that Britain's roads continue to be among the safest in the world. Most are doing good work but the latest data shows that there is room for improvement.

>I want each motorist to be confident that a visit to the garage ends with their car repaired to a high standard by reputable mechanics rather than uncertainty about cost and the quality of service.

>Giving drivers the very best information about garage performance is absolutely key to achieving this goal. It means that responsible garages will be well placed to reap the commercial benefits of transparency. Garages where performance is not up to scratch will find themselves under pressure to do more for their customers.

## **Notes to Editors**

  * There are 35 million MOT tests conducted at 21,000 authorised premises across Great Britain every year. The cost to motorists of the test alone is around £1.5bn. 

  * The garage sector is regulated in several ways. The sector has to comply with business laws and consumer protection legislation. The MOT scheme is regulated by VOSA, an agency of the Department for Transport. 

  * Self-regulation has an important role to play also. For example, over 6500 garages self-regulate their customer service through the Motor Codes Ltd Code on Service and Repair which has full approval status under the OFT Approved Codes System. And nearly 1000 garages have been accredited with the BSI Kitemark scheme for automotive services.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120131,Cutting red tape to tackle road works disruption,Plans to axe red tape for councils wanting to put in place schemes to tackle disruptive road works.,"Plans to axe red tape for councils wanting to put in place schemes to tackle disruptive road works were published today by Regional and Local Transport Minister Norman Baker.

Street works permit schemes give councils more power to coordinate works and once in place both utility companies and local authorities must abide by strict conditions including time limits, coordination or the amount of road space to be left available to road users. Anyone who breaks the terms of their permit or works without a permit could be prosecuted and face a fine of up to £5,000. 

At the moment, councils wanting to operate a permit scheme need approval from the Department for Transport. The proposals put forward today would remove that requirement and give councils more flexibility in putting the schemes in place. 

Norman Baker said:

>Councils should be spending their time improving the lives of their local residents not being bogged down by unnecessary bureaucracy.  That is why I am proposing that local councils should be able to put in place permit schemes to improve the co-ordination of works on their roads without needing to get approval from central government. 

>I hope that this will encourage more councils to develop permit schemes and make use of them to help reduce disruption and frustration for the travelling public.

Under the plans, councils will still need to comply with the law on the penalties and requirements they can impose on utility companies when operating a permit scheme. 

The [Consultation on 'permit schemes'](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-02/) runs until 13th April. 

## Notes to Editors

  * Street works permit schemes are currently in place in Kent, London and Northamptonshire.
  * The Secretary of State approved a permit scheme for St Helens in December 2011 and has received permit schemes applications submitted from East of England and Greater Manchester.
  * A council running a permit scheme is able to charge companies for providing a permit although any charge should cover the costs of administering the permit scheme and should not result in a surplus.  It is a criminal offence to work without a permit. The maximum fine will be £5,000. It is also an offence to not meet a permit condition, for which the maximum fine is £2,500. Fixed Penalty Notices, as an alternative enforcement mechanism, can instead be given for working without a permit or not meeting a permit condition.
  * Local councils are responsible for designing and consulting on their own scheme proposals.  Under current legislation, permit schemes in England can be implemented only with the approval of the Secretary of State. Councils in England have been able to apply to the Department for Transport to run their own road works permit schemes since the relevant Regulations came into force in April 2008.  The Department for Transport's business plan sets out the intention to end the need for central government approval of individual local authorities' permit schemes in 2012.  Legislative proposals to do this will require Parliamentary approval. Under the proposals the position in Wales would remain the same.

The new system could potentially see decisions on capital funding for local schemes - including new local roads, public transport schemes, better pedestrian routes, and new local rail stations - devolved to democratically accountable local transport bodies. 

Currently central government must approve all schemes over £5m. The Government is proposing that from 2015 local transport bodies will be able to decide for themselves how to spend their money on priorities best suited to their local needs without Whitehall approval. 

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said:

>We want a system that is much more responsive to local needs and it makes good sense to give local residents and passengers a greater say in the transport infrastructure that they rely on so much.

>These proposals could hand real power to communities so they can make locally accountable decisions on what transport improvements are needed in their area. This is a key plank to our localism agenda, freeing local authorities from central government control, so I look forward to responses from across the country.

The primary role of local transport bodies - involving both Local Enterprise Partnerships and local authorities - would be to agree, manage and oversee the delivery of a prioritised programme of transport schemes from 2015 onwards. 

The Department for Transport is spending around £1.7bn on local transport projects between 2011 and 2015. Today's consultation proposes allocating funding to local transport bodies by formula rather than a competitive bidding process. 

In return for devolution, the bodies would need to assure the Government of governance and financial management arrangements, accountability for decisions and achieving value for money.   

## Notes to Editors

  1. [Consultation Paper : Devolving local major transport schemes](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-04/)

  2. In December, the Government announced the final schemes to be funded out to the end of the current Spending Review period (2011/12 to 2014/15). This largely decides which schemes are to be funded up to April 2015. This consultation paper is about what happens for future schemes, for the period beyond 2015. 

  3. The level of funding available for the period post April 2015 will be decided in due course. In the meantime, we are seeking views on the formula and its distribution.

  4. The consultation proposes that local transport bodies decide and agree their prioritised programme of schemes by next April 2013.

  5. Budgets will be allocated by formula rather than bidding to Department for Transport. The Department proposes to publish a range of indicative allocations per individual Local Enterprise Partnership area by August 2012.

  6. The Government proposes that the local transport bodies would be responsible for establishing a balanced programme of local major scheme priorities for delivery beyond 2015. They would oversee the delivery of individual schemes, but would not be the vehicle for their delivery, which would remain with individual local authorities or other relevant delivery agencies. 

  7. The purpose of the consultation paper is to achieve the best outcomes for the economy whilst balancing the need for developing sustainably and reducing carbon emissions and putting in place a system which is fit for purpose in practical delivery terms. 

  8. There are 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships**, **tasked with determining local economic priorities and undertaking activities to drive growth and create local jobs. [http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/economic-development/leps](http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/economic-development/leps)

  9. The average cost to central government of a local major scheme under the previous Government's Regional Funding Allocation was around £30m. However, individual schemes ranged from less than £10m, such as the £5m A631 West Bawtry Road Improvement, to over £200m, such as the Manchester Metrolink extensions. The vast majority of schemes by number are in the region of £5m and £30m.

  10. There would no longer be a £5m threshold defining a major scheme, meaning that a scheme of any size or on any network could potentially be prioritised and funded within a given allocation, where this is seen as a local priority.

  11. The Government expects local transport bodies to continue to secure third party contributions under a devolved system.

  12. It is proposed that individual schemes would need to meet minimum value for money thresholds, be appraised in line with webTAG (DfT's well-evidenced best practice guidance on appraisal and evaluation) and follow the Transport Business Case framework.  But capable local transport bodies would have the freedom to appraise schemes themselves.

  13. The new system has been designed to encourage decision-making across Local Enterprise Partnership boundaries to local transport consortia - groupings of Local Enterprise Partnership areas - in order to manage a handful of big schemes, which were experienced under previous systems.   However, the Government will not force consortia formations, which have to be right for local areas.

Councils wanting to bring in controls on their roads - for example to allow road works to take place or to vary parking restrictions - must put in place a Traffic Regulation Order detailing what the controls cover. Currently, councils and the Highways Agency must advertise in local newspapers both when these orders are proposed and when they come into effect.

The Department estimates that these adverts cost councils and the Highways Agency around £20 million every year - around 60 per cent of these costs are covered by the taxpayer with the rest being paid for by businesses such as utilities and property developers when arrangements are made to allow them to carry out works on the road.

Today's proposals will remove the need to advertise in local newspapers and will instead give local authorities the freedom to publicise changes to those likely to be affected in ways that they think will reach them best. Councils would still have to publicise changes but could choose different means such as advertising on local websites, displaying notices in the area or distributing leaflets on affected roads. They may still choose to use local newspaper advertising where they think that is the best way to target their audience. Putting these decisions into the hands of local councils forms part of the Government-wide drive to get rid of unnecessary regulation under the Red Tape Challenge, and to allow local councils more freedom.

Norman Baker said:

>It is right that residents and businesses are told about changes to their local roads. But councils and the Highways Agency should have the freedom to use their local knowledge to decide how best to do this rather than being forced to spend taxpayers' money on indiscriminate advertising.

>These changes will save council taxpayers, the Highways Agency and businesses millions of pounds that they will now be able to spend on improving services for local residents.

At the same time as relaxing the current requirements for local authorities to consult specific organisations, the Department is proposing to add a requirement for traffic authorities to consult town or parish and district councils in order to improve local engagement.

The [consultation opens today and closes on 23rd April 2012](/consultations/dft-2012-06/).

Today also sees new rules coming in to place which will mean that councils will no longer need Whitehall approval to introduce certain traffic signs. These changes will add more signs to the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions so that councils can use them without gaining specific approval, reducing bureaucracy for local councils and giving them greater flexibility.

Under 'lane rental' schemes councils will be able to charge utility companies up to £2,500 a day to dig up the busiest roads during peak times when road works cause the most disruption. This will incentivise utility firms to carry out their works more quickly and at times when roads are quieter. Companies would be able to avoid the charges by carrying out works during off-peak periods or, if appropriate, at night.

Following consultation, the Department for Transport has today published guidance for local authorities wanting to put lane rental schemes in place. In order to gather evidence on the effectiveness of lane rental, the Department has proposed that schemes should initially be used in up to three pioneer authorities - one metropolitan area and two others - and is inviting applications from interested local authorities. The successful pioneer areas will need to have exhausted other options, including using a permit scheme. They will also be required to evaluate their lane rental schemes annually and this evidence will be used to decide how further lane rental schemes should be implemented.

Norman Baker said:

>It is incredibly frustrating to find vital roads being dug up in the middle of the rush hour or, even worse, traffic lanes closed when no one is even carrying out any work.

>This disruption is not only inconvenient but very expensive, with roadworks-related congestion costing the economy an estimated £4 billion a year, which is why we are taking firm action.

>While permit schemes are working well to reduce disruption from roadworks in areas where they have been sanctioned we think it sensible to try out a further option. We believe lane rental schemes provide a further incentive to utility companies and local authorities to carry out their works at times when they will cause the minimum disruption and to complete them as quickly as possible.

The guidance which accompanies the new powers makes it clear that lane rental charges must be avoidable and proportionate to the costs of congestion. Councils are also being encouraged to apply the same principles to their own works and come forward with lane rental schemes which fit the needs of their local area.

Any revenue raised from the implementation of lane rental charges will have to be used by councils to fund measures which could help to reduce future road works disruption. This could include infrastructure work, research or measures to improve the management of works.

### Notes to Editors

  * The consultation '[Lane rental schemes in England](/consultations/dft-2011-25/)' closed on 31st October, and the guidance '[Lane Rental Schemes: guidance to English local highway authorities'](/publications/lane-rental-schemes/) can be loacated in the publications section.
  * Lane rental regulations will be laid before Parliament shortly.
  * Any authority wishing to implement lane rental would need to apply to the Department for approval to do so. Local councils will need to propose charge levels that are appropriate to their individual circumstances. In particular, they will need to show that their charges are proportionate to the costs imposed by works on the roads in question.This is subject to a maximum charge of £2,500 per day.
  * The primary legislation (section 74A of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991) provides the necessary powers for local highway authorities to put in place lane rental schemes, subject (in England) to the approval of the Secretary of State, and allows Regulations to make further provision about such schemes.
  * Lane rental pilot schemes were operated in Camden and Middlesbrough between 2002 and 2004, but no further schemes have since been implemented. As a result of subsequent changes to various aspects of street works legislation, the existing lane rental Regulations are now out of date and, in effect, inoperable.
  * Permit schemes give local authorities greater powers to co-ordinate works on their roads. Permit schemes are currently being operated by Transport for London and most of the London boroughs, Kent County Council and Northamptonshire County Council. Approval has recently been granted for a new scheme in St Helens.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120106,Norman Baker calls Satnav Summit to help motorists find way,Announcing the first 'Satnav Summit' to thrash out solutions to end the misery caused when drivers follow out of date directions from satnavs.,"[Norman Baker, Local Transport Minister](/ministers/norman-baker/), will host the Government's first 'Satnav Summit' to thrash out solutions to end the misery caused when lorry and car drivers follow out of date directions from their satnavs.

The Minister wants highway authorities, mapping providers and satnav manufacturers to work more closely to ensure everything possible is done to make sure the right vehicles are on the right roads.

At present, it can take months for map updates to make their way from local councils to satnavs. As a result, thousands of drivers follow out-of-date maps, and local residents end up with inappropriate traffic on their doorsteps. Furthermore, some motorists do not update their satnav maps, either because they forget or are not aware they can do, which makes the problem even more serious.

The summit will take place in early March, a month before local authorities gain important new powers to decide how their roads appear on maps - helping them to better direct traffic.

Norman Baker said:

>Out of date directions mean misdirected traffic - a scourge of local communities. It is vital highway authorities, mapping companies and satnav manufacturers work more closely together to provide drivers with accurate, up-to-date information on traffic restrictions such as narrow roads or low bridges.

>This will help prevent huge lorries from being sent down inappropriate roads and ensure motorists are given the best possible directions.

>The summit is timely because from April we are allowing local authorities to reclassify roads - ensuring A roads are placed where they want traffic to run and lowering the category of road in places they want traffic to avoid - rather than having to come to Whitehall for approval. These powers will help councils make sure that drivers are using suitable routes.

The summit will be attended by the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transportation (ADEPT) - which represents councils in transport - and ITS(UK) which promotes intelligent transport technology and whose membership includes satnav companies.

It is essential that there are clear lines of communication which allow councils to quickly get road classification information to satnav companies so route calculation software can be updated.

Ministers are also tackling the misery caused by lorry drivers following satnavs down narrow and inappropriate roads as part of a package of new traffic signs rules.

Under the new rules confirmed last month councils will no longer need Whitehall approval to introduce certain new signs or some existing ones that they need to use on a regular basis - including one to warn lorry drivers of unsuitable roads.

Tough new measures to crack down on drivers who abuse the disabled parking system - including a new Blue Badge design which is harder to forge - will come into force on 1 January, Transport Minister Norman Baker said today.

Previously, Blue Badges were made from card and handwritten but from the New Year disabled drivers will be able to apply for an electronically printed badge, much like a driving licence. The new badge will have security features such as a unique hologram, digital photo and serial number allowing parking attendants to check for genuine badges more easily through the windscreen.

Blue Badge fraud is estimated to cost the UK £46 million a year and it is generally accepted that reform is urgently needed. The new badge is part of a wider crackdown on misuse of the scheme to ensure disabled parking spaces can only be used by those most in need.

Other measures include:

  * shared administration between authorities resulting in faster renewals, less abuse and operational efficiency savings of up to £20 million a year;
  * better customer service for badge holders, including being able to apply for and renew badges online using Directgov, as well as access to a new national helpline number. From April 2012 customers will also be able to report lost and stolen badges online;
  * wider use of independent mobility assessments to determine eligibility. To support this local authorities will now have control of National Health Service spend on Blue Badge assessments; and
  * extending the scheme to more disabled children under three years of age and severely disabled Armed Forces personnel and veterans; and removing residency requirements for disabled service personnel and their families who are posted overseas on UK bases.

Transport Minister, Norman Baker, said:

>Motorists who pretend to be disabled to get some free parking are frankly disgraceful. They prevent real Blue Badge holders from using parking bays designed for those genuinely in need and they cheat the vast majority of road users who play fair when they park their cars.

>Our new Blue Badge will be as secure as a banknote and anyone thinking of faking it can forget it. We are also tightening up on enforcement and eligibility so there will be no way to scam the system.

Blue Badges provide a vital lifeline to more than 2.5 million disabled people every year by prioritising key parking spaces close to important services. However, increasing levels of badge fraud have meant those spaces are often full.

Earlier this year, the Government announced the most comprehensive changes to the Blue Badge Scheme for 40 years. The launch of the new badge is the last stage in a raft of measures which have begun to come into force since April.

Helen Dolphin, Director of Policy and Campaigns at Disabled Motoring UK, said:

>After years of campaigning for improvements to the Blue Badge Scheme, I'm delighted that changes that make the scheme fit for the 21st century have been introduced. The new badge design will stop badges being so easily forged and new guidance to local authorities will make the issuing of badges fairer. The Blue Badge is a fantastic scheme and all these changes will help ensure the scheme will only benefit those it was intended for.

The Department for Transport has awarded 27 police forces across England a total of £2.7million. The funding, together with police and the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) contributions, will enable them to purchase 37 scanners.

The technology saves time by quickly making a 3D image of the whole crash site, rather than investigators painstakingly surveying multiple sections of a scene. This digital image of the site can then be viewed on a computer screen remotely allowing investigators to take measurements of where vehicles are in relation to each other and examine other important evidence.

The wider roll-out of 3D laser scanning technology is part of a Government-led initiative known as 'CLEAR'. This initiative is delivering an action plan aimed at reducing delays caused by incidents in order to keep traffic moving - a vital element in securing the UK's prosperity.

Mike Penning said:

>There is nothing more frustrating than being stuck in a traffic jam for hours on end. But even worse than that is the shocking £1 billion cost of those lost hours for our economy. That is why we are determined to improve the clear-up of accidents so we can get our motorways re-opened as quickly as possible.

>Today's £2.7 million DfT funding award will see 3D laser scanners rolled out quickly where they are needed most. This will benefit drivers by reducing incident clear up times by 39 minutes on average.

>I would like to thank police forces for seizing this opportunity to purchase laser scanners and contributing funds towards the purchase. This clearly demonstrates how forces are committed to helping to keep traffic moving, in support of economic growth, as well as continuing to deliver their vital role in ensuring the safety and security of all road users. I would also like to thank the National Policing Improvement Agency for providing a contribution to the funding.

Last year (2010) there were more than 18,000 full or partial motorway closures lasting a total of more than 20,000 hours.

A Government strategy to tackle congestion caused by motorway closures and drive down the £1bn annual cost to the economy was published in May by the Minister.

Assistant Chief Constable Sean White, of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), said:

>On behalf of the police service we welcome enormously this important funding opportunity that has been made possible by Government through the Department for Transport. The provision of the latest, leading edge 3D laser scanning technology to assist in the expeditious and detailed scanning of collision scenes will make a very important contribution to properly investigating fatal and life changing collisions whilst always being mindful of the level of economic and other disruption that closures of the strategic road network inevitably cause.

>Police forces acquiring this equipment will be in a better position to manage such critical events in a more efficient way and present the most accurate and detailed evidence from the laser scanning devices to criminal, civil and coroners' courts. The equipment will be deployed day and night across England and will make a real difference to improving the capability of collision investigators, reducing delays for all road users and re-opening motorways and other strategic roads at the earliest opportunity.

>As agencies we will work together in the months ahead to closely monitor the introduction of this new equipment to ensure that the benefits of this investment are fully realised both for collision investigation and the free flow of traffic.

Chief Constable Nick Gargan, the Chief Executive of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), said:

>The 3D laser scanning project is innovative and will enable motorways to be opened more quickly after incidents, passing a direct benefit to the public. The National Policing Improvement Agency is pleased to support the project, which also brings significant improvements in supporting better outcomes in policing and increased efficiency in officer time.

> The project also supports a standardised approach to surveying motorway incident scenes, in line with the police service's Information Systems Improvement Strategy (ISIS) strategy of using IT to enable business change within the service.

### Notes to Editors

  1. In September, police forces across England were invited to bid for a share of a £3.14 million Government fund for the purchase of 3D laser scanners to reduce the length of time motorways are closed by incidents.
  2. The fund was open to bids from the 38 police forces in England who have responsibility for policing the strategic road network. They had until November 23 to bid for the Department for Transport money on a match-funding basis.
  3. Of the 23 bids received and assessed, only one application, the City of London's was deemed ineligible (on the grounds that it did not police routes on the strategic road network). The remaining 22 bids were awarded grants totalling £2.7 million.
  4. Funds have been distributed to areas where the highest impact could be made. We have also ensured that there is a good geographical spread based on the assessment criteria such as: 
    * The busiest/worse performing routes (reliability), whether these form part of the Olympic route network (ORN) (the presence of alternate ORN routes, as well as in some cases key arteries that, while not on the ORN, could be directly related to specific Olympic venues not in the force's area;
    * Total delay savings within each police region and the extent to which such savings offer high or very high value for money;
    * The number of collision investigations undertaken between April 2008 and March 2011;
    * The level of contribution from applicants, the minimum being 30% of the whole-life capital package.
  5. To launch the Government strategy to tackle congestion caused by motorway closures, a [press release](http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=419573&SubjectId=16&AdvancedSearch=true) and [Written Ministerial Statement](/news/statements/penning-20110519) were issued and a [report published in May](/publications/investigation-and-closure-procedures-for-motorway-incidents). 
  6. The strategy has recently been rebranded as CLEAR (Collision, Lead, Evaulate, Act, Re-open).

#### Further information about laser scanners

  1. In carrying out collision investigation the police already use technology to survey an incident scene to assist in understanding what may have happened. 3D laser scanning technology used in the recent trials enables the faster capture of survey data, thereby potentially reducing the time taken for this part of the investigation process.
  2. In 2009, the Highways Agency (HA) carried out an independent trial of 3D laser scanning technology (LST) using results from separate trials conducted by the Metropolitan Police Service and Humberside Police. The trials which where completed in September 2010 found that on average the LST saved a total of 39 minutes per incident.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20111221,New steps to keep HGVs on the right road,Ministers are tackling the misery caused by lorries following satnavs down narrow and inappropriate roads as part of a package of new traffic signs rules.,"Ministers are tackling the misery caused by lorry drivers following satnavs down narrow and inappropriate roads as part of a package of new traffic signs rules.

Under the new rules, laid before Parliament by Transport Minister Norman Baker, councils will no longer need Whitehall approval to introduce certain new signs or some existing ones that they need to use on a regular basis - including one to warn lorry drivers of unsuitable roads.

The Government believes the changes will cut bureaucracy and give councils the flexibility to make sure their roads reflect the reality of modern driving and cycling. 

Among the new signs councils will now be able to use without needing to get Government approval are those indicating that a route is unsuitable for lorries - designed to tackle the problem of lorry drivers using inappropriate roads because they are following satnavs - and signs indicating charging points for low emission vehicles.

Norman Baker said:

>I am bringing an end to the ludicrous situation where councils have to come to central government for permission to put up signs they need to use on a regular basis to manage their roads. 

>This will also allow them to more easily introduce new signs - like those which will prevent satnavs directing huge lorries down narrow country lanes.

>By adding these signs to the list of those which councils can use without needing Whitehall approval we will be reducing costs and bureaucracy as well making sure that the needs of 21st century drivers and cyclists are met.

Currently councils must either use signs authorised in the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (2002) or gain specific approval from the Department for Transport. The changes being put forward will add more signs to the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions so that councils can use them without gaining specific approval. This measure - taken forward as a result of the Traffic Signs Policy Review - will reduce costs and bureaucracy for local councils and cut the number of authorisations the Department needs to process by around one third.

The signs which will be added to the list of those which councils can use without Government approval include those indicating:

  * Routes which are unsuitable for heavy goods vehicles. To reduce the problems caused by drivers following satellite navigation systems down narrow roads, a new information sign has been authorised for use warning of roads which are unsuitable for lorries; 
  * Dedicated parking bays for car club vehicles and electric vehicle charging points;
  * That contra-flow cycling is permitted on one-way roads without councils needing to put in place expensive traffic engineering. This allows cyclists to use quieter side roads rather than busier main routes and follows trials across London;
  * Timings for cycle routes. Councils will now be able to make cycle routes more user-friendly by putting up signs showing how long it will take to reach a destination on a cycle route rather than just showing the distance; 
  * Available headroom warnings. Currently, councils wanting to indicate headroom warnings in metric and imperial measurements must use two separate signs. From now on councils will be able to use one sign showing both measurements, reducing clutter and cutting costs. Councils will still be able to use a single sign displaying imperial units only;
  * Roads where toads may be crossing the carriageway. Toads on the carriageway can present a skid risk to drivers and signs warning drivers that toads may be on the road are currently allowed to be used from February to May. To allow for the effect of climate change on toad migration, councils can put the warning sign in place a month earlier without needing to gain approval;
  * Restricted parking zones and permit parking areas.

Other changes include:

  * Allowing Highways Agency Traffic Officers additional powers to direct traffic on the motorway and trunk road network. This will free up police resources and reduce the time it takes to get traffic moving after an incident;
  * Councils will no longer be able to put in place signs using the phrase 'Nearly Full' to describe availability at car parks. Instead, local authorities will be able to display the number of spaces available at any one time, providing clearer, more useful information to motorists looking for somewhere to park;
  * Giving councils greater flexibility on the number of repeater signs they use to help reduce costs and clutter. Councils will still need to have at least one repeater sign after a specified threshold in any zone or limit but will have greater responsibility for deciding on the appropriate level of repeater signing after that point.

The statutory instrument outlining the changes to the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions is expected to take effect from 30 January 2012.

## Notes to Editors

1. Images of the signs are available on request.

2. The Department published its report on the Traffic Signs Policy Review (""Signing the Way"") in October. The review sets out a new framework for traffic signing in Great Britain which, whilst maintaining consistency, will provide more flexibility for local authorities to deliver signing appropriate to the environment.

3. Highways Agency Traffic Officers will be given powers to direct traffic while carrying out their incident management duties. This includes being able to direct traffic:

  * to cross double white lines
  * to stop within a controlled area indicated by zig-zag lines 
  * to pass lane closure light signals (to diagram 6031.1) on motorways and all-purpose dual carriageway roads 
  * to stop within a bus stop clearway",12/21/2011,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--30,

As a result of the Road Transport Red Tape Challenge - the government wide process to get rid of unnecessary, burdensome and overcomplicated regulation - the Department for Transport is:

  * Scrapping the regulation requiring motorists to hold a paper counterpart to their driving licence by 2015 - saving drivers up to £8m.
  * Improving the regulation surrounding the notification process for vehicles that are not in use on the road (Statutory Off Road Notification or SORN). Once drivers have notified the DVLA that their vehicle is SORN, they will no longer have the burden of annual SORN renewal.
  * Only issuing hard-copies of V5C vehicle registration certificates for fleet operators when needed, with the potential to be rolled out to private motorists.
  * Introducing a limited exemption from drivers' hours rules so that those who also drive as Territorial Army reservists in their own time can continue to do so.

Following a vigorous process of challenge, both by the public and within Whitehall, a total of 142 road transport regulations will now be scrapped or improved.

Justine Greening said;

> ""Motorists shouldn't have to keep numerous bits of paper just to prove they can drive and have bought insurance - we live in digital age and we need to embrace that.
> 
> ""Reducing the number of rules and regulations in our life is absolutely vital to removing barriers to economic growth and increasing individual freedoms. This whole process just proves that there's so much sitting on our statute books that at the very least needs a good spring clean or can be scrapped entirely.""

Business and Enterprise Minister Mark Prisk said:

> ""I'm delighted that so many motoring regulations will be scrapped or improved, particularly those that affect business.
> 
> ""The Red Tape Challenge has built up real momentum since it was launched in April. Overall, of over 1200 regulations considered so far, we have agreed to scrap or improve well over 50 per cent.
> 
> ""We have already published regulations covering 12 themes, and there are 13 themes to come, so there remains huge scope for reducing the burden of regulation on business and individuals even further.""

Other proposed changes to road transport regulations include:

  * Removing the need for an insurance certificate. The Department for Transport will work with the insurance industry on removing the need for motorists to have to hold an insurance certificate.
  * Abolishing the requirement for drivers to prove they have insurance when applying for tax meaning 600000 more people will be able to tax their car online. This has been made possible by new checks of existing databases for insurance under new Continuous Insurance Enforcement rules. The DVLA's records are compared regularly with the Motor Insurance Database (MID) to identify registered keepers of vehicles that appear to have no insurance.
  * We will look at experience in other countries on driver Certificates of Professional Competence (CPC) - the qualification for professional bus, coach and lorry drivers. In particular, to see if we could remove the need for some sectors, such as farmers who drive stock to market, from needing a CPC.
  * Local Authorities will now have to ensure business interests are properly considered as part of any future proposed Workplace Parking Levy scheme. They must show they have properly and effectively consulted local businesses, have addressed any proper concerns raised and secured support from the local business community.
  * Abolishing the regulations on the treatment of lost property on buses. Bus companies currently have to wait 48 hours before they can throw away perishable items left on the bus.

### Notes to Editors

  1. The Red Tape Challenge was launched by the Prime Minister on 7 April. It gives the public the chance to have their say on some of the 21,000 regulations that affect their everyday lives. The website is available at: [http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/)
  2. Measures agreed as part of the Road Transport Red Tape Challenge can be found here: [http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/gov-20110520](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/gov-20110520)
  3. These proposals are as a result of the Road Transport Red Tape Challenge theme which was launched 20th May 2011, as part of a government-wide initiative aimed at reducing bureaucracy.br />  
  
Within the Road Transport Red Tape Challenge, the Department placed over 400 regulations online. After removing those that have already lapsed, 376 remain - of which 142 will be scrapped or improved.  

| | Keep as is | Improve | Scrap | Moved* |
| Number | 226 | 84 | 58 | 8 |
| Percentage | 60.1% | 22.3% | 15.4% | 2.1% |

* Moved regulations predominantly relate to another theme, and will be resolved in a different part of the red tape challenge.

  4. The road transport theme launched on 20th May and attracted 2,097 comments to the Red Tape Challenge website, many from members of the public and businesses. The Department also received a number of written submissions from trade associations and professional bodies.
  5. Under Continuous Insurance Enforcement it is an offence to keep an uninsured vehicle, rather than just to drive when uninsured. The DVLA's records are compared regularly with the Motor Insurance Database (MID) to identify registered keepers of vehicles that appear to have no insurance. Vehicle keepers then receive a warning letter and if they fail to take action face a fine, court action or having their vehicle clamped, seized or destroyed. All drivers can check their vehicle is recorded on the MID for free.
  6. The Maritime and Rail Red Tape Challenge was launched on 10th November 2011. They can be found here: [http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/maritime-and-rail/](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/maritime-and-rail/)
  7. The Red Tape Challenge process does not include legislation or regulations falling within the responsibilities of the devolved administrations, tax and fees legislation or national security matters. The breakdown of the 21, 851 'live' statutory instruments is as follows:  

| a. | Assigned to RTC themes | 10960 |
| b. | Commencement/ appointed day orders | 2868 |
| c. | Devolved/ crown dependencies orders | 3555 |
| d. | Tax and fees | 4268 |
| e. | National Security | 200 |
| f. | Misc. (SIs on Machinery of Government,General Synod, international requirements etc) | c.2000 |

The [A14 Challenge](/consultations/dft-20111212/) will deliver major improvements to this key Cambridgeshire transport corridor.

All ideas for delivering quicker, more reliable and safer journeys on the route between Cambridge and Huntingdon are welcome. These will help shape the recommended package to be announced by the Department for Transport next summer.

The Challenge is focussed on finding a long term solution to the capacity and congestion problems on the corridor - in particular between Ellington and Fen Ditton. Alongside this, a £20m package was announced last month for quick win measures to reduce congestion and lessen the impact of incidents on the route.

Mike Penning said:

>I urge anyone with an interest in tackling the congestion problems currently experienced on the A14 to submit their ideas for improvements to the A14 Challenge.

>This is far from being a study about what the problems are - they have been studied before and are well known. This is a great opportunity for local stakeholders to shape the solution.

>We do not believe that, on its own, a simple road building solution is likely to be the best option. That's why local knowledge and understanding in areas such as public transport, local roads, freight facilities and land use development is vital to enrich the final package.

In last month's Autumn Statement, the Government announced its commitment to increasing capacity and improving performance on the A14. As well as boosting economic growth, this will support proposed housing developments in Northstowe, and Alconbury, and potential further development at Waterbeach.

One area where innovative ideas will be welcome is in financing major improvements. The Government has no intention of charging road users for an unimproved facility but would expect to consider tolling for enhanced capacity.

The views of participants in the Challenge will help DfT, Cambridgeshire County Council, other local authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships develop proposals by next spring and reach recommendations on a preferred solution by next summer.

Input will be collected by DfT from its dedicated email inbox, web based survey. In addition Cambridgeshire County Council, Suffolk County Council and Northamptonshire County Council will be gathering views from key local stakeholders in January.

### Notes to Editors

  1. A14 Challenge documentation can be found on the Department for Transport website at: [http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-20111212/](/consultations/dft-20111212/)
  2. On 29th November as part of the Growth Review, the National Infrastructure Plan announced measures to improve the A14 including an improved bypass for Kettering, £20m for immediate improvements including junction upgrades at the Girton and Spittals interchanges, additional signage for drivers and a study into longer term improvements between Ellington and Fen Ditton.
  3. The A14 Challenge is part of the longer term study and encourages participation in the solutions process both from those affected by and those that can help deliver solutions. Cambridgeshire County Council and the DfT are jointly managing this.
  4. An earlier £1.2bn proposal was withdrawn on affordability grounds, and now options to toll additional capacity on an improved A14 are likely to be looked at, as will road capacity enhancement, public transport provision, freight alternatives, information, and improved resilience to incidents. Tolling an unimproved A14 has been ruled out.
  5. Views from the A14 Challenge will be received by DfT until the end of January. After that contributors of particular merit may be asked to work with the Department's consultants in finalising and testing options. The study will report in summer 2012.
  6. Any schemes that resulted would be subject to the normal procedures, including formal consultation.

Christmas drink drive campaign","Designated drivers will be rewarded in more than 8,000 pubs and student union bars across the country as part of the THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign, launched today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.

This year's THINK! Christmas drink drive campaign will include radio advertising, posters in pub washrooms, online search activity and targeted Facebook advertising to remind drivers of the personal consequences of a drink drive conviction.  THINK! have also teamed up with Coca-Cola's Designated Driver campaign to offer drivers across the country free soft drinks at venues this Christmas as part of the Driver Friendly campaign. 

Drivers will be able to find participating venues using the Coca-Cola 'Pub Finder' tool, either online or via their smart phones.

THINK! campaign activity will be aimed at young men aged 17 - 29, who are consistently over-represented in drink drive casualty figures.

Mike Penning said:

>The number of drink drive deaths has fallen by more than 75% since 1979, but drink driving is still devastating lives with around 250 people killed in collisions where a driver was over the limit last year. 
 
>Our THINK! campaign makes it clear that drivers who get behind the wheel over the limit risk losing their licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence.

>We are also teaming up with Coca-Cola and pub chains across the country to reward designated drivers as part of our Drive Friendly initiative, as well as reminding people of the consequences of getting a drink drive conviction. 
 
>No one wants to spend their Christmas in a police cell.  My message is clear:  don't drink and drive.

Jon Woods, General Manager, Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland said: 

>The holiday period is coming around quickly and everyone is beginning to make their plans.  With the majority of adults preparing to visit a pub or bar over the festive period we are proud to be partnering the Government's THINK! Initiative to reward responsible drivers.  Designated Drivers provide a fantastic service by helping their friends and family get home safely at the end of a night out.  That's why we think it is so important to recognise and reward them.  To do this we will be offering a free Coke or Diet Coke to drivers, ensuring they have a good night too and to encourage others to do the right thing.

The THINK! drink drive campaign runs from 1st December 2011 to 1st January 2012. [For more information and the facts](/think/).

Designated drivers should ask at the bar about how to take advantage of the buy one, get one free offer on Coca-Cola or Diet Coke at participating venues from 9th December 2011.

Driving Standards Agency's Chief Executive Rosemary Thew said:

>Not all examiners are members of the PCS union and we cannot be sure that those who are will not turn up for work. We therefore want candidates to attend so that practical tests can be delivered if possible. Theory tests are not affected and will be taking place as planned.

>Candidates who turn up but are unable to take their tests because of industrial action will not have to contact DSA to re-book. They should hear from us with a new date within five to ten working days. We apologise for the inconvenience this will cause and are doing everything we can to minimise disruption for our customers.

If no examiner is available for a test, a new date will be rebooked automatically by DSA and the candidate will be sent details of the new test. If candidates fail to attend they will not be able to claim out-of-pocket expenses if their tests are cancelled - and they will need to rebook their own tests.

DSA's customer service centre for practical tests might also be affected by the strike action. Customers who wish to book a practical test will still be able to use our internet booking service at [direct.gov.uk/drivingtest.](http://www.direct.gov.uk/drivingtest)

Speaking on the day of the publication of the review, Alan Cook said:

>The management of our strategic roads is at odds with every other major infrastructure sector in the UK. By applying the lessons learnt by the best performing companies in other sectors, there is the potential to save taxpayers at least £200 million a year after 5 years, and to provide a much better service for road users and the wider economy.

>The report recommends that the Secretary of State for Transport should take on a new, more strategic role in the management of the network, providing longer-term funding certainty for the organisation and acting as a champion for the interests of road users and the economy through a performance specification with tough new targets for efficiency and customer service. Alongside of this, the report also recommends reforming the status of the current Highways Agency, giving it a more independent Board, which can make better and more flexible commercial decisions with greater financial autonomy.

Mr Cook concluded:

>The importance of this network to the growth of the economy is enormous. It handles a third of all traffic in England and two-thirds of all freight traffic. But policy makers need to be much clearer about what they want the network to deliver in return for the public money that is spent on it. Meeting the country's current economic and financial challenges demands a change in our approach.

The Barry driving test centre closed earlier this year, with tests moving to Cardiff and Bridgend, but from 5 December the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) will deliver tests on a part-time basis from the Business Support Centre on Barry Waterfront.

Today's move is part of a national trial to provide a more local service for driving test candidates. The trial offers practical car tests in selected areas across England, Scotland and Wales that do not currently have a local test centre but still have a significant demand for tests. The aim is to provide a service for the local community and ensure that candidates are able to take their test at a convenient location. 

As well as using conventional driving test centres, tests are also being delivered from other sites such as hotels, leisure centres or local authority buildings, as is the case in Barry.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>I am delighted that driving tests will be returning to Barry.

>I want us to be more flexible and innovative in delivering driving tests to make sure that we are offering people the best service possible wherever they live.

>Our aim is to offer a local service that is convenient for candidates as well as being cost effective.

Testing in Barry will take place on a part time basis, initially two days a week, but this may change depending on the level of demand.

In addition to the trial in Barry, DSA is running trials in six other areas across the country. All the trials will be carefully monitored to assess any impact on levels of customer service and the cost of delivery, as well as making sure the integrity of the test is maintained.

DSA will then decide whether the trials can be rolled out on a permanent basis and extended to other areas without a local test centre where there is a significant demand, as well as suitable test routes and venues.

The trials only involve practical car tests; theory test centres are not affected.",11/15/2011,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,making-roads-safer,Driving Standards Agency,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,

>I want us to be more flexible and innovative in delivering driving tests to make sure that we are offering people the best service possible wherever they live. 

>Our aim is to offer a local service that is convenient for candidates as well as being cost effective.

Testing at both sites in Wiltshire will take place on a part time basis two days a week. Tests will be conducted from the Longfield Community Centre in Trowbridge from 12 December, and from the Leighton Recreation Centre in Westbury from 15 December.

In addition to the trial in Wiltshire, DSA is running trials in six other areas across the country. All the trials will be carefully monitored to assess any impact on levels of customer service and the cost of delivery, as well as making sure the integrity of the test is maintained.

DSA will then decide whether the trials can be rolled out on a permanent basis and extended to other areas without a local test centre where there is a significant demand, as well as suitable test routes and venues.

The trials only involve practical car tests; theory test centres will not be affected.",11/15/2011,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,making-roads-safer,Driving Standards Agency,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,

Fe gaeodd canolfan profion gyrru'r Barri yn gynharach eleni, gyda phrofion yn symud i Gaerdydd a Phen-y-bont, ond o'r 5 Rhagfyr bydd yr Asiantaeth Safonau Gyrru (DSA) yn cyflenwi profion yn rhan amser o'r Ganolfan Cefnogaeth Busnes ar Lannau'r Barri.

Mae'r cam heddiw yn rhan o arbrawf cenedlaethol i ddarparu gwasanaeth mwy lleol i ymgeiswyr ar gyfer y prawf gyrru. Mae'r arbrawf yn cynnig profion gyrru ymarferol mewn ardaloedd dethol ledled Cymru, Lloegr a'r Alban ble nad oes canolfan brofi leol ar hyn o bryd ond sy'n dal a galw sylweddol am brofion. Y nod yw i ddarparu gwasanaeth i'r gymuned leol ac i sicrhau y gall ymgeiswyr gymryd eu prawf mewn lleoliad cyfleus. 

Yn ogystal a defnyddio canolfannau prawf confensiynol, mae profion hefyd yn cael eu cyflenwi o safleoedd eraill megis gwestyau, canolfannau hamdden neu adeiladau awdurdodau lleol, fel yn yr achos hwn yn y Barri.

Meddai'r Gweinidog Diogelwch Ffyrdd Mike Penning: 

>Rwy'n falch iawn y bydd profion gyrru yn dychwelyd i'r Barri. 

>Rwyf am i ni fod yn fwy hyblyg ac arloesol o ran cyflenwi profion gyrru i sicrhau ein bod yn cynnig y gwasanaeth gorau posibl i bobl ble bynnag maent yn byw. 

>Ein nod yw i gynnig gwasanaeth lleol sy'n gyfleus i ymgeiswyr yn ogystal a bod yn gost effeithiol.

Bydd profion yn y Barri yn digwydd ar sail rhan amser, ar ddau ddiwrnod yr wythnos i ddechrau, ond fe allai hyn newid yn ddibynnol ar y lefel o alw.

Yn ogystal a'r prawf yn y Barri, mae'r DSA yn cynnal arbrofion mewn chwech ardal arall ledled y wlad. Byddant oll yn cael eu monitro yn ofalus i asesu unrhyw effaith ar lefelau gwasanaeth cwsmeriaid a chost cyflawniad, yn ogystal a sicrhau y cynhelir cywirdeb y prawf. 

Yna bydd y DSA yn penderfynu a ellir cyflwyno'r profion ar sail barhaol a'u hymestyn i ardaloedd sydd heb ganolfan brofi leol ble mae galw sylweddol, yn ogystal a llwybrau a lleoliadau addas ar gyfer profion.

The study reviewed lorry parking facilities, including their capacity and levels of use, as well as other indicators of demand.  The final report gives hauliers, councils and potential private sector investors a comprehensive picture of the demand for lorry parking and facilities easily accessible from the strategic road network as well as identifying hotspots where there is currently inadequate supply to meet demand.

It is also hoped that making more information available about where facilities can be found will make it easier for drivers to find places where they can park up safely.

Mike Penning said:

>Making this information available to drivers and operators will make it easier for them to know where facilities are available.  It will also help developers and local councils who want to plug gaps in the market helping to boost growth in the sector.

>I hope that by providing better information we will see more high quality lorry parking facilities in the places where they are most needed.  This will improve safety for drivers and reduce disruption for local residents.

There will also be discussions with the Road Haulage Forum on proposals to improve the provision and quality of parking facilities, with local authorities to explore best practice in tackling problems with inappropriate parking and between stakeholders in Kent to agree a solution to the problems caused by Operation Stack.

## Notes to Editors 

  1. The report by AECOM is [available on the Department's website](/publications/lorry-parking-study)
  2. The report lists the number of lorries using parks in each local authority when the survey was carried out and the number parking in lay-bys and industrial estates.  The report also compares the situation in each local authority with neighbouring ones, which will help Local Authorities explore the potential for co-ordinating resources and initiatives to restrict inappropriate parking.
  3. The Road Haulage Forum was established by the Department to give haulage trade bodies and representative unions a formal opportunity to work in partnership, providing a forum through which to discuss areas of mutual concern and interest with Government officials on a regular basis. 
  4. ""Operation Stack"" is the parking of Channel bound freight traffic on the M20 motorway. It is initiated and implemented by Kent Police, when there is disruption to cross channel travel.   Several thousand goods vehicles may be parked on the M20 at this time, with obvious disruption to non-freight traffic.",11/10/2011,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,providing-effective-regulation-of-freight-transport,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,

Classic and historic vehicles are often very well maintained by their owners and have a much lower accident and MoT failure rate than newer cars. The current requirement for these vehicles to undergo an MoT test goes over and above the obligations set out in European legislation. As part of the Government's commitment to cutting unnecessary red tape, today's proposals would exempt private vehicles manufactured before 1960 from the MoT test, reducing costs for owners.

Mike Penning said:

>We are committed to reducing regulation which places a financial burden on motorists without providing significant overall benefits. Owners of classic cars and motorbikes are enthusiasts who maintain their vehicles well - they don't need to be told to look after them, they're out there every weekend checking the condition of the engine, tyres and bodywork.

>That is why I am today putting forward proposals to scrap the MoT test for these vehicles - this will result in savings for the Government and for motorists.

Many of the features of the modern MoT test are not suitable for testing classic vehicles built more fifty years ago. However, owners of classic vehicles will still be legally required to ensure that their cars are safe and in a proper condition to be on the road

These changes are being taken forward separately from the Department for Transport's main MOT review.

The consultation starts today and closes on 26 January 2012. The consultation document can be found here: [www.dft.gov.uk/consultations](/consultations).

## Notes to editors

  * Pre-1960 licensed vehicles (vehicles manufactured prior to 1 January 1960) make up about 0.6% of the total number of licensed vehicles in Great Britain (GB), but are involved in just 0.03% of road casualties and accidents.
  * Evidence shows that the initial MoT test failure rate declines by the age of vehicle after the vehicle is 13 years old.

The National Driver/Rider Training Standard(TM) sets out the skills, knowledge and understanding required to deliver driver and rider training programmes for cars, light vans and motorcycles, both before and after a candidate has passed their test.

The standard sets out what instructors need to be able to do, and the knowledge they need to have, in order to deliver effective learning that will help people to become and remain safe and responsible drivers. This covers areas such as devising effective lesson plans, understanding different learning styles and needs, and giving clear instructions and constructive feedback. The document builds on DSA's existing National Driving and Riding Standards(TM) that help to define safe and responsible driving and motorcycling.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>The driver and rider training industry has a vital role to play in making sure that Britain's roads remain among the safest in the world.

>The publication of this standard will help to ensure that all drivers acquire the right skills, knowledge and attitude to use our roads safely.

The DSA has developed the National Driver/Rider Training Standard(TM) in collaboration with the driver and rider training industry, and will continue to seek feedback from trainers to ensure the standard remains relevant and up to date.

DSA chief executive Rosemary Thew said:

>I want to thank the driver and rider training industry for their input in to the development of the standard. This document contributes to the work the DSA is doing to modernise the industry, and is an important step towards improving the way people are taught to drive and ride.

The publication of the standard fulfils the commitment made in the Government's Strategic Framework for Road Safety to specify national standards for professional instructors, and will help to inform ongoing discussions around the modernisation of the driver and rider training industry.

This follows a commitment given earlier this year by the DfT to support and provide funding contributions for Bikeability for the remainder of the parliament.  A total of £11m has been made available for cycle training during financial year 2011/12, helping to deliver up to 275,000 cycle training places to school children aged between 10-11. 

Norman Baker announced the funding whilst on a visit to Chalk Ridge Primary School in Basingstoke, where he observed children taking part in Level 2 Bikeability training which involves cycling on the road. Chalk Ridge Primary School will have 52 training places delivered.

Norman Baker said:

>This Government is strongly committed to cycling - it is a crucial part of building a healthy and sustainable transport network for the future.  That is why we have provided £11m of funding this year for the Bikeability programme, which not only promotes the benefits of cycling as a healthy and enjoyable way of getting around, but enables children to do it safely and confidently.

Local Authorities bid for Bikeability grants in advance of the financial year starting.  In addition, Schools Games Organiser Host Schools - who are responsible for co-ordinating PE and school sport with partner schools - bid for grants via the Youth Sport Trust.  There are two opportunities each year for them to bid for funding and today's announcement sees the first allocation.  There will be another allocation of funding in November this year.

Jim Blaber, Deputy Head, Chalk Ridge Primary School, said:

>The Bikeability scheme is very important; it allows pupils to develop a lifelong skill, encourages independence, promotes a healthy life style choice and ensures that the children are safer when cycling on our busy roads.

The DQC proves that a driver holds the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) which professional bus, coach and lorry drivers must now legally hold in addition to their driving licence.

Drivers with a photocard licence will receive their DQC automatically, as the same photograph can be used for both documents. While drivers will still have to pay the usual £20 photocard licence fee, they will benefit from receiving their DQC free of charge, which could save them up to £30 over the 10 year photocard licence period. 

Rosemary Thew, DSA chief executive said:

>We're urging drivers to exchange their paper licence sooner rather than later. As well as saving money, drivers holding a photocard licence will receive their DQC automatically when they have passed the Driver CPC initial qualification or completed 35 hours of periodic training.

Those drivers leaving the exchange of their licence until after they have completed their training may risk a delay in receiving their DQC.

Drivers can apply to exchange their licence online or by post or they can drop off their application at DVLA local offices and selected Post Office® branches.

Since the introduction of the two part motorcycle test in 2009, candidates had to travel to the mainland to take the off-road, module one part of the test. But from this week the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) will be conducting module one tests at Anderson High School in Lerwick.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>Our aim is to provide a local service that is both convenient for candidates and cost effective.

>We want to offer people the best service possible wherever they live so I am delighted that riders in the Shetlands will soon be able to take their whole motorbike test without needing to travel to the mainland.

The move is part of an initiative to make module one tests available more locally by using non-DSA sites on a part-time, casual-hire basis. 

At present the majority of module one tests are conducted from purpose-built off-road test centres. However, in rural or remote areas where candidates have to travel a long distance to take the module one test, DSA is working with motorcycle trainers to identify suitable local sites where tests can be delivered, such as car parks and motorcycle trainers' sites.

The Selly Oak Relief Road - to be known as Aston Webb Boulevard, was built with a Government contribution of more than £38m towards the total costs of £61m. It is expected to cut through-traffic from the existing A38 by half, helping to revitalise Selly Oak centre by creating a safer and less congested environment for cyclists, pedestrians and people arriving by public transport. It will also become the main route to the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

Transport Minister Norman Baker said: 

>I am very pleased to be able to open the new Aston Webb Boulevard today. It is an important scheme for Birmingham, which will bring huge pluses both for people living locally and those travelling through the area.

>Not only will the scheme provide substantial benefits to the local community by removing a large amount of traffic from the centre of Selly Oak, it will also provide a better route for bus services and make it easier and safer for residents to walk and cycle.

>This scheme has also been the catalyst for major investment in the Selly Oak area including the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital, so it ticks both boxes of creating growth and cutting carbon, which are my two transport priorities.

The name for the new road - Aston Webb Boulevard - was chosen by Birmingham residents. Sir Aston Webb was a prominent 19th century architect who designed the Great Hall on the University of Birmingham campus which overlooks the new road.

Councillor Timothy Huxtable, Cabinet Member for Transport, Environment and Regeneration, said: 

>By both easing congestion in Selly Oak and greatly improving transport links and business opportunities along the new road, this project will bring great benefits to local motorists, residents and businesses alike.

>Logistically, building the road across the path of both the canal and railway has certainly proved a major engineering challenge for the Council and its construction partner Birse Civils Ltd, but I am glad to say it is a challenge we have risen to whilst keeping disruption to trains and boats to an absolute minimum.

## Notes to Editors: 

  * The scheme, promoted by Birmingham City Co., comprises a new 2.5km road to the west of the A38 Bristol Road and Selly Oak shopping centre, located along a major arterial route into Birmingham from the M5 and the south west. It also involves improvement works to the existing A38, including a reduction in carriageway width, a new bus interchange, bus priority measures and better provision for cyclists and pedestrians.

The new dual three-lane bridge and associated link roads will form a major new transport route improving links between the Liverpool City region, north Cheshire and the wider North West to the rest of the country.  It will also ease the significant congestion currently experienced by users of the Silver Jubilee Bridge, reducing journey times by up to 10 minutes at peak times. 

Construction of the new bridge - known as the Mersey Gateway Bridge - is expected to begin in 2013 and is due to be open for traffic in 2016.  The construction cost (including land) is around £600m which the Department for Transport will support with a mixture of capital grant and revenue funding for the bridge's continued operation. 

The existing Silver Jubilee Bridge, located 1.5 miles to the west of the planned bridge, will be converted into a local traffic bridge with priority for buses and improved conditions for pedestrians and cyclists.  There will be toll charges for those using both crossings to help fund a significant proportion of the scheme.  The funding provides for discount schemes, which would be prioritised for local and regular users.

**Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:**

>The Mersey Gateway Bridge is an important transport project which will improve journeys and boost economic growth.  It will not only provide much needed traffic relief for the existing Silver Jubilee Bridge, but also help to regenerate the Borough of Halton, the Liverpool city region and the wider north west by improving transport links, maximising local development and regional economic growth opportunities.     

>In response to the Government's request to reduce costs, Halton Borough Council have achieved savings of around £30m on the original proposed cost - meaning the scheme will offer better value to the taxpayer, whilst bringing vital improvements to the region. Further cost savings are expected through a competitive procurement process.

>I was determined to ensure that the agreed funding package represented a robust and sustainable funding model for the bridge that protected both the taxpayers and the residents of Halton.  This is a good result.

>We have already committed to support local transport schemes across England to the value of £870m in the current spending review period, with a further £650m worth of schemes expected to be funded in December. This means we will have invested £1.5bn on improving local transport across the country in the current spending review period.

### The benefits of the new bridge include

  * Relieving congestion on the Silver Jubilee Bridge and improving public transport links across the River Mersey between the two parts of Halton; 
  * Improving accessibility in the region;
  * Improving local air quality and enhancing the urban environment; and
  * Encouraging increased use of cycling and walking.

**Steve Nicholson, Director, Mersey Gateway Project, said: **

>We have been working very closely with Government over recent months to finalise the details of this agreement and I am delighted with the results. This agreement represents the best possible deal for the public purse and means that we can focus on delivering a project that will bring benefits to local people, commuters and businesses from across the region.

### Notes to Editors

  * This announcement allows Halton Borough Council to start the procurement process for the project which will take around two years.  Final approval enabling construction to begin will be subject to successful completion of the procurement process. 
  * The Department for Transport will provide £86m in capital grant towards land and remediation and up to £14.55m per year in long term revenue support for 26.5 years from opening.
  * Following the spending review, local authorities were challenged to look again at the cost of proposed transport schemes to ensure value for money.  Nine schemes were given the go ahead in February after £45.5m (14%) of savings were identified. 
  * The Mersey Gateway Bridge was a more complex project with a detailed and complex financial structure which has taken longer to assess and conclude the funding agreement with Halton Borough Council. Halton Borough Council have identified cost savings for the new bridge of around £30m (5%) with further savings expected to be delivered through the procurement process
  * The approved scheme will have a 1000m length span, with three towers of up to a maximum of 140m in height in the River Mersey. It will also include link roads from the existing highway network.
  * Construction cost is expected to be £589m (including land purchase and remediation)
  * Tolls will be levied on the new bridge and the existing Silver Jubilee Bridge with toll levels expected to be similar to those seen on the Mersey Tunnels (currently £1.50 per car).
  * Both bridges will be operated by a Mersey Gateway Crossings Board - an independent subsidiary of Halton Borough Council.
  * A private sector operator will build, finance and operate the bridge (inc managing toll collection) in return for an annual payment from the Crossings Board.
  * The Crossings Board will raise the revenue to cover the annual charge from the tolls paid by those using the bridge and will also benefit from the grant from DfT.",10/3/2011,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-2011100,Government proposes 80MPH motorway speed limit ,Transport Secretary announces his intention to consult on raising the national speed limit on motorways from 70 to 80 miles per hour.,"Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 has announced his intention to consult on raising the national speed limit on motorways from 70 to 80 miles per hour. The Government plans to launch a full public consultation on the issue later this year with a view to implementing any change in early 2013.

Vehicles have changed dramatically since the current national speed limit was set in 1965. Technological advances mean that cars are significantly safer then they were - contributing to a fall of more than 75% in the number of people killed on British roads since 1965. That is why the Government feels it is now time to look again at whether the speed limit set in 1965 is still appropriate.

Road safety is a top priority for the Government and action is being taken to tackle uninsured driving and help police enforce against drink and drug driving. However, the Government believes safety cannot be the only consideration when setting speed limits. Previous analysis shows that raising the motorway speed limit would generate significant economic benefits, worth hundreds of millions of pounds per year from savings of travel time.

Initial work by the Department suggests that setting the motorway speed limit at 80 mph is likely to represent the best balance of costs and benefits and it is similar to the motorway speed limit in other EU countries.

As many as 49% of drivers currently break the 70mph limit. Ministers believe that raising the limit to 80mph would mean that millions of otherwise law-abiding motorists would be brought back inside the boundary, restoring the moral legitimacy of the system.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>I want to make sure that our motorway speed limit reflects the reality of modern vehicles and driving conditions, not those of 50 years ago.

>While we must ensure that our roads remain among the safest in the world, we must also consider the huge economic benefits that can be created by shortening journey times.

>Increasing the speed limit on motorways from 70 to 80 miles per hour for cars, light vans and motorcycles could provide hundreds of millions of pounds of benefits for the economy and I will put forward formal proposals for making these changes later this year.

## Notes to Editors

  1. An increase to the national motorway speed limit would apply to England and Wales. Responsibilities are devolved in Northern Ireland and are planned to be devolved in Scotland.
  2. Increased motorway speed limits would apply to cars and motorcycles. Lorries on motorways are subject to lower speed limits and we have no proposals to increase them. The consultation is however likely to seek views about the position related to vans/light goods vehicles on motorways.
  3. A thorough impact assessment which takes account of the full environmental, social and economic costs and benefits is being progressed.
  4. Some stretches of motorway would be likely to retain a 70 mph limit because of their engineering and environment.
  5. We are also considering the case related to increasing the speed limit on other high standard, near-motorway dual carriageways. Changes would be implemented case by case and we are not proposing to consult about raising the default national speed limit of 70 mph for all purpose dual carriageways.",10/3/2011,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,

>We will be recruiting new Traffic Commissioners to replace Philip Brown and Tom Macartney but in the interim their work will be covered by the remaining commissioners.

In the interim, Richard Turfitt has been appointed to temporarily act as Traffic Commissioner for the South Eastern and Metropolitan Traffic Area in addition to his existing role as Traffic Commissioner for the Eastern Traffic Area. Beverley Bell, Traffic Commissioner for the North Western Traffic Area and Deputy Senior Traffic Commissioner, will be temporarily covering the North Eastern Traffic Area.

Details of the recruitment exercise will be appearing on the [Cabinet Office Public Appointments website](http://publicappointments.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/). The Department is keen to encourage applications from anyone who may have a relevant industry background.

## Notes to editors

  1. The Traffic Commissioners are appointed by the Secretary of State as statutorily independent Licensing Authorities responsible for bus, coach and goods vehicle operators and for local bus service registrations. They can also take disciplinary action against bus, coach and lorry drivers who commit road and certain other offences. Further details about [traffic commissioners](/topics/tpm/traffic-commissioners/).
  2. The role of Senior Traffic Commissioner gives the post-holder important responsibilities to determine how the Traffic Commissioners perform their statutory functions. For example: 
    * Determining which statutory functions each Traffic Commissioner works on. This could allow Traffic Commissioners to specialise in particular areas - for example, goods vehicle operator licensing or local bus service registrations;
    * Issuing general directions and guidance to the Traffic Commissioners and Deputy Traffic Commissioners. Directions cover administrative matters such as how to apply for an operators' licence. Guidance covers judicial matters such as how to interpret legislation.
  3. The policy and legislation on local bus service registrations are devolved in Scotland. The powers of the Senior Traffic Commissioner do not extend to bus service registrations in Scotland.

The move comes after the Government secured £45 million private sector investment for a new 2.9 mile congestion-tackling dual carriageway running east from the A5 north of Dunstable to the M1 at a new junction (J11a).

The scheme is intended to improve journey time reliability and safety by removing the need for long distance traffic to travel on the A5 through Dunstable.

The contribution - which totals £50m when combined with Central Bedfordshire Council's previous commitment to allocate £5 million Growth Area Funding - significantly reduces the level of Government investment needed to deliver the scheme.

This means work could start in 2014 - rather than sometime after 2015 - subject to successful completion of statutory processes and confirmation of value for money and affordability.

Mike Penning said:

>The budget deficit means we have had to make tough choices about investment priorities for the strategic road network, ensuring we get maximum value for money for every pound that we spend.

>I have said that private investment can help progress transport projects and the £50m contribution to the costs of the A5-M1 link road is an example of this.

>The third party funding significantly improves the return on public investment for this scheme and I am pleased to announce that the public inquiry, which was suspended last year, can be re-started. I'd like to thank the council and developers for their commitment to this scheme.

The Planning Inspectorate has now been asked by the Highways Agency to nominate an Independent Inspector to conduct the Inquiry. The Agency anticipates the Inquiry will be held in the New Year; however an announcement will be made when an inspector has been appointed and the date and venue arranged.

The A5-M1 link road scheme was originally due to go to Public Inquiry in June 2010. It was postponed due to the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review, the result of which - announced in October - was that the project was identified as a ""future scheme"" for start of work post 2015.

Following representations from Central Bedfordshire Council and developers Lands Improvement Holdings and Friends Life Company offering a contribution towards the cost of the scheme, the Secretary of State agreed that, subject to an agreement being in place for the contribution, the Public Inquiry would be re-started.

Details about the scheme including the Environmental Statement and other reports can be seen on the Highways Agency website at: [www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4472](http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4472.aspx)

**Notes to Editors**

The Highways Agency has today issued a public notice of the intention to hold a Public Inquiry into the A5 - M1 Link Road scheme.

The new link road would connect to the A5 just to the north of the existing A5/A505 roundabout junction.

The scheme aims to ease congestion on the A5 through Dunstable by providing an alternative route for road users between the A5 and the M1.

The scheme has a cost-range estimate of £156m to £212m.

The assessments will be carried out by specially trained examiners at the King's Lynn driving test centre.

Taxi licences are granted by local councils who decide whether or not to introduce a special assessment before they issue the licence. Over 160 councils throughout Great Britain have taken DSA's taxi assessment on board as a road safety initiative. 

King's Lynn & West Norfolk Borough Council is the latest to join the list of those councils who have introduced the scheme either for new taxi licence applicants or to quality control current taxi drivers. 

DSA's central operation change manager Phil Coop said: ""We are delighted that King's Lynn has decided to introduce this assessment. Driving a taxi carries a great deal of responsibility.""

Specifically trained driving examiners assess the ability of applicants to drive safely and professionally in a 'real' environment. The test includes manoeuvres designed specifically with the operational taxi driver in mind and is set at a higher standard than the practical test for learner drivers.

Type approval is used to certify that a vehicle meets minimum European standards on safety and exhaust emissions.   Vehicles which are type approved can be sold and registered throughout Europe without further approval restrictions being imposed by Member States.

The proposed new regulation would replace existing legislation setting out the requirements manufacturers must meet when presenting new motorcycles, three wheeled vehicles and quadricycles for type approval.  The proposed changes include bringing all type approval requirements for these vehicles under one regulation rather than several, as is currently the case, as well as introducing new requirements on vehicle safety and environmental impact.

Roads Minister, Mike Penning, said:

>This is a chance for both motorcycle manufacturers and riders to have their say on this new EU Regulation. 

>I hope as many people as possible will respond to the consultation and give us the benefit of their knowledge and experience as we progress towards the negotiating stage on these new rules.

So far 75 English local authorities have published some or all of their information showing accident and casualty rates as well as speeds at camera sites before and after the introduction of speed cameras.  This will allow local residents to see whether speed cameras are having a positive impact on accident rates in their areas. 

All local authorities were asked to publish information about the effectiveness of their speed cameras as soon as practicable and provide a web link to this material by 20th July 2011.  The remaining 72 authorities plan to publish their data in the next few weeks.

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>Local residents have a right to expect that when their council spends money on speed cameras, they publish information to show whether those cameras are helping to reduce accidents or not. 

>I hope that this information will help local people to make informed judgements about the impact cameras are having on their local roads.

>However, residents can only hold their council to account if it has made information available so I would urge those councils which have not yet published their data to do so as soon as possible.

Links to the local authorities' information can be found on a central hub on the Department's website. 

Police forces are to publish the number of prosecutions arising from each permanent or long term temporary fixed camera site in their area each year, along with the total number of offences recorded by all cameras and the total numbers of offenders given a fixed penalty notice, or taken to court and the numbers of people opting to complete speed awareness courses.  Some forces, including Cambridgeshire, Dorset, Lancashire, and Thames Valley have already provided some offence data but in most cases this information will be published by police forces later in the year.  The Department will then review the position related to the publication of speed camera information with the police.

Under 'lane rental' schemes councils would be able to charge utility companies to dig up the busiest roads during peak times when road works cause the most disruption. Companies would be able to avoid the charges by carrying out works during quieter periods or, if appropriate, at night. 

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>Everyone knows how frustrating it can be when you are sat in a traffic jam, unable to get to work or drop off the children at school because someone is digging up the road. 

>This disruption is expensive as well as inconvenient, with one estimate valuing the loss to the economy from road works congestion at £4 billion a year. We simply cannot afford this.

>That is why I am putting forward proposals which would incentivise utility companies and local authorities to carry out their works at times when they will cause the minimum disruption to the travelling public.

The Department for Transport has today published a consultation and draft guidance to councils outlining how lane rental schemes could be implemented. Any councils wishing to put in place a lane rental scheme would need to gain approval from the Department. 

In order to gather evidence on the effectiveness of lane rental, the Department has proposed that schemes should initially be used in one urban and one non-metropolitan area. 

The proposals are clear that lane rental charges must be avoidable and proportionate to the costs of congestion. Councils are also being encouraged to apply the same principles to their own works and come forward with lane rental schemes which fit the needs of their local area.

Any revenue raised from the implementation of lane rental charges would be used by councils to fund measures which could help to reduce future road works disruption. This could include infrastructure work, research or measures to improve the management of works.

The consultation will close on 31st October 2011.

## Notes to Editors

  1. The consultation document can be found here: [www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-25](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-25)
  2. Local councils will need to propose charge levels that are appropriate to their individual circumstances. In particular, they will need to show that their charges are proportionate to the costs imposed by works on the roads in question. This is subject to a proposed maximum charge of £2,500 per day.
  3. The primary legislation (section 74A of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991) provides the necessary powers for local highway authorities to put in place lane rental schemes, subject (in England) to the approval of the Secretary of State, and allows Regulations to make further provision about such schemes.
  4. Lane rental pilot schemes were operated in Camden and Middlesbrough between 2002 and 2004, but no further schemes have since been implemented. As a result of subsequent changes to various aspects of street works legislation, the existing lane rental Regulations are now out of date and, in effect, inoperable.",8/22/2011,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,,Department for Transport,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110803,Government urges commuters and businesses to travel differently during London 2012,Transport Minister urges commuters and businesses in London to think differently about how they travel during next years Olympic Games.,"Transport Minister, Norman Baker, today urged commuters and businesses in London to think differently about how they travel during the Olympic Games, as he marked a year to go to what is likely to be one of the busiest days on the transport network. 

Modelling by Games organisers predict that 3 August 2012 will see an extra three million trips made on top of the 12 million trips on public transport made during an average London workday. This is due to it being the first day for track and field, and with events at larger capacity venues such as the Olympic Stadium, Horse Guards Parade and the Aquatics Centre, the number of spectators are likely to peak.

In order to manage the increased number of people using the capital's transport network, the Government wants commuters and Londoners to travel and work differently during the Games. For example commuters who live near work, or travel short distances within central London, are being urged to cycle or walk to work. Those who live further away are being encouraged to try different routes; stagger their journey times to avoid the busiest periods; work remotely; or use video conferencing for meetings.

Norman Baker was speaking at BT where he was shown innovative new ways for businesses and individuals to work remotely from both home and the office. He said:

>The Games will be a once-in-a-generation test for both our transport system and our adaptability. As we edge ever closer to the Olympics, hand-in-hand with new investment must go new solutions.

>I am the first ever transport minister to have official responsibility for alternatives to travel and the Olympics will be a key time to really embrace these ideas. It's time to oil the creaking bike, dig out the walking boots, work out how to use the video conferencing equipment, and fire up the laptop gathering dust at the back of the cupboard. 

>And of course Government has to play its part - at DfT we'll be cutting our travel footprint by half during the Games, with similar initiatives across Whitehall. But all businesses need to play their part too - there's plenty of help and advice out there so no excuse why we can't reduce the amount we travel during the 17 days of the Games.

In the run up to the Olympics around £6.5 billion has been invested in upgrading and extending transport links including the first ever domestic high speed train in Britain, new stations, more tube trains and line extensions. And, as well as the big ticket items, investment has been put into everyday improvements such as innovative customer travel information systems and more user-friendly walking, cycling and river routes.

Stuart Hill, BT's Vice-President for Central Government and 2012, said:

>BT is working to make London 2012 the most connected Games ever - not just for people at home, but for organisations too. BT is working with businesses and public sector bodies of all sizes to help minimise the impact of travel disruption during the Games. 

>We offer a range of communications services that will help them to boost productivity while eliminating costs. This includes our deployment of super-fast fibre broadband services, cloud-based voice and data services, secure remote working services and video conferencing. By investing in flexible working solutions such as these now, organisations can ensure they remain fit for the Games and well into the future.

Up to 800,000 spectators and 55,000 athletes, officials, organisers and members of the media will be travelling to and from the Olympic venues every day. The overall transport ambition is to reduce non-Olympics demand during the Olympics by 30 percent, although there will need to be larger reductions at specific stations and lines.

Hugh Robertson, Minister for Sport and the Olympics, said:

>The transport network has received significant investment to ensure it is able to cope with the demands of Games time, but we also need the assistance of London businesses to help everybody travel around the capital smoothly. By thinking creatively and adjusting travel patterns next summer, we can ensure that everybody gets to their destination and London keeps moving.

The Department for Transport has committed to reduce the travel footprint of the department by 50 per cent at Games time. DfT staff will reduce commuting, keep business travel to a minimum, and rearrange deliveries and collections where possible. The Department is testing out different ways of working and travelling in a trial week from 8 -12 August 2011 and has a wider programme of work with business representatives to develop a strategy on alternatives that will reduce the need for commuting and business trips - not just now but looking forward to the next 20 years.

2. There are more than 12 million public transport journeys in the capital daily and Londoners are already benefiting from a transport legacy before the Games, delivered by all 2012 transport partners - LOCOG, ODA, TfL, Network Rail, Highways Agency, Mayor and DfT - working in partnership, including: 

  * 50 per cent increase in DLR capacity with line extended to Woolwich and, soon, Stratford International;
  * Extra capacity on the Jubilee line - with an increase to 27 trains an hour (from 24 an hour) - will be delivered by the end of July;
  * Extra capacity on the Central line;
  * Refurbished and extended London Overground services on the East London and North London lines;
  * Upgrades to national rail services on the Lea Valley and Great Eastern lines;
  * Upgraded traffic signals and junctions on the ORN, so traffic runs smoothly; 
  * King's Cross-St Pancras and Stratford stations essentially rebuilt and expanded, with step-free access and extra capacity;
  * Southfields step-free and Green Park will be step-free before the Games, a vital accessibility hub;
  * Improved walking and cycling routes serving the Olympic Park; 
  * Barclays Cycle Hire scheme will reach Stratford by 2012.

3. Norman Baker was given a demonstration by BT of a global voice service that provides a variety of access types, on-net and off-net call handling, integration with mobility and unified communications solutions. He also saw ways to streamline business communications by combining enterprise voice, presence, instant messaging and conferencing in a single, unified platform.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110803-2,New government guidance on minicabs to give volunteers and care workers a smoother ride,"New guidance means volunteers, childminders and care workers won't have to be licensed as minicabs.","Volunteers, childminders and care workers should be freed from the unnecessary and costly process of being licensed as minicabs following guidance published by Transport Minister, Norman Baker today.

Changes to the minicab licensing laws in 2006 mean that some councils have been classing people like childminders - who drive children to and from school in their own vehicles, and care workers - who assist elderly people in their homes, as minicab drivers.  The new guidance makes it clearer which vehicles the Government believes need minicab licences - and those that do not, removing the burden on Local Authorities of licensing vehicles unnecessarily. 

Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>'Dad's Taxi' is often a joke in many families, but we don't need councils perpetuating the myth!

>Clearly parents helping out at a play group, or carers getting people to the doctor are not minicab drivers. I hope that by publishing this new guidance today these people will be able to get on with their vital activities, without the hassle or cost of getting a minicab licence.

>Councils will also benefit by cutting out unnecessary paperwork which wastes valuable time and money. This is good, common-sense Government.

Some childminders have ended up doubling up on CRB checks because of the confusion.  Other examples include care workers being asked to complete the minicab driver 'knowledge test'.

Groups the Government considers should be exempt from licensing their vehicle are:

  * Private ambulances, including emergency vehicles and vehicles which operate as part of a formal patient transport service;
  * Volunteers who share their car or provide lifts as part of their voluntary duties;
  * Care and support worker services, including those who care for adults in their own homes, in community settings or in residential or nursing care homes;
  * Childminders who carry children as passengers as part of their duties;
  * Rental car companies and garages offering 'courtesy lift' services for customers, for example whilst their car is in for repair.

Colin Angel, Head of Policy and Communication at the UK Homecare Association, said:

>We warmly welcome the Department for Transport guidance.  It is an unnecessary burden to ask homecare workers to apply for a minicab licence.  We hope that councils will agree that these infrequent trips help elderly and disabled people maintain their independence and quality of life, and are not a cab service.

Stuart Turner, Director of Professional Standards at the National Childminding  
Association, said:

>This guidance will be welcomed by registered childminders, and will help to ensure they are not required to hold a private hire vehicle licence when taking children on the school run or on trips to the park. It's vital that children can access learning and development opportunities out in the community, and this guidance will help to ensure childminders can continue to offer this for children in their care.

The guidance is another important action from the Government's Plan for Growth, published alongside the Budget in March, aimed at boosting the vital contribution to the economy from the social care system.

  * The [Plan for Growth](http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf), published alongside the Budget in March, examined the healthcare sector and set out number of measures to break down barriers and promote opportunities to help improve the important contribution it makes to the economy.

  * The Road Safety Act 2006 repealed the exemption from private hire vehicle (PHV) licensing for vehicles used on contracts lasting not less than seven days.  Although DfT produced a simple guidance note at the time of the repeal, the In House Policy Consultants concluded that there were too many ''grey areas"" where local authorities simply did not know whether or not certain vehicles (eg childminders, private ambulance operators, home carers etc) should be licensed.  DfT committed itself to producing a more robust and definitive guidance note as a result of the IHPC report.  The new guidance published today fulfils that commitment.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110726,Save money on your holiday driving,How holidaymakers can save money by using smarter driving techniques.,"As families get ready to head off on their summer holidays, drivers were reminded today by Transport Minister Norman Baker of the savings they can make from adopting smarter driving techniques.

Smarter driving techniques include simple actions like driving smoothly, changing gears at the right time and clearing out clutter from the car.  Following these driving techniques could save drivers 8 per cent or even more, on their fuel costs.

Norman Baker said:

>For many families, the annual holiday will be the longest trip they make all year.  Applying the simple smarter driving techniques could make a real difference to fuel costs.  In a single 500 mile trip, you could save £10 - certainly enough for a few extra ice creams to keep the kids happy!
 
Useful smarter driving tips for a holiday trip include:

**Check your tyre pressures**.  Remember to check your tyre pressures before leaving home.  Underinflated tyres are not only dangerous but also increase fuel consumption.  Tyre pressures should be checked regularly throughout the year but this is particularly important if you're planning a long journey with a heavily loaded car as this will put additional stress on your tyres. 

**Watch your speed**.  Fuel consumption increases dramatically with speed:  At 85mph a car uses approximately 25per cent more fuel than at 70mph, and at 70mph approximately 10 per cent more than at 60mph.  So try to leave plenty of time for your journey, consider breaking a long journey overnight, and take plenty of on-board entertainment for the kids to reduce the pressure to arrive quickly.

**Consider how you use roof racks and roof boxes.**  At motorway speeds a roof box can increase fuel consumption by around 25 per cent.  So if you're using a roof box it's particularly important to try to keep your speed down.  And when you reach your destination consider taking the box off if you're not going to need it until your return journey.

**Avoid congestion.**  Traffic jams may leave you fuming and will also increase your fuel consumption.  So plan your journey well and perhaps avoid travelling at times when traffic is likely to be particularly heavy, such as Friday afternoons or the first day of the school holiday. 

Other key tips that apply year-round:

  * When accelerating, change up through the gears early, usually by 2000rpm.
  * And remember that when driving in town most fuel is used in accelerating a vehicle so try to anticipate well ahead and drive as smoothly as possible to avoid unnecessary acceleration and braking.
  * Drivers could brush up on their smarter driving techniques with a quick lesson. Many driving instructors and schools now offer smarter driving, or eco-driving, training to experienced drivers. 

## Notes to Editors

  * Following  the smarter driving tips on Directgov can save around 8 per cent on fuel costs, and reduce a car's CO2 emissions by the same percentage.  There is the potential for even higher savings; evidence from practical training delivered by the Energy Saving Trust indicate that drivers achieve an average 15 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency immediately following a lesson.
  * The Department for Transport supports smarter driving training by providing funding to the Energy Saving Trust to offer subsidised training to groups of drivers through their employers. Local authorities have also been encouraged to support smarter driving training in their areas, including in bids made to the Local Sustainable Transport Fund.
  * Further advice on smarter driving can be found on Directgov under [Driving your car: green tips ](http://www.direct.gov.uk/ecosafedriving) or on the [Energy Saving Trust website](http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Travel/Drivers/Smarter-driving), which also includes a video clip of smarter driving training.

>Rwyf eisiau inni fod yn fwy hyblyg ac yn fwy arloesol wrth gyflawni profion gyrru i sicrhau ein bod yn cynnig y gwasanaeth gorau bosibl i bobl ble bynnag maent yn byw.

>Ein nod yw darparu gwasanaeth mwy lleol sy'n gyfleus i ymgeiswyr ac sy'n gost-effeithiol ill dau.

Mae'r DSA yn gweithio i adnabod llwybrau prawf addas yn ardal Y Barri ac i ddarganfod lleoliad sy'n cynnig y lefel gywir o wasanaeth ar gyfer ymgeiswyr.

This is one of seven trials to provide practical car tests in selected areas that do not currently have a local test centre but still have a significant demand for tests. 

The test centre in Barry closed in March 2010 when DSA's lease expired, and tests moved to Cardiff and Bridgend. This trial will explore whether tests can also be provided more locally, possibly using alternative venues such as local authority buildings, hotels or leisure centres. 

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said: 

>I want us to be more flexible and innovative in delivering driving tests to make sure that we are offering people the best service possible wherever they live. 

>Our aim is to provide a more local service that is both convenient for candidates and cost effective.

DSA is working to identify suitable test routes in the Barry area and find a venue that offers the right level of service for candidates. 

There are plans for trials across England, Scotland and Wales. Each trial will be closely monitored to assess any impact on levels of customer service and the cost of delivery, as well as making sure the integrity of the test is maintained. 

DSA will then decide whether the trials can be rolled out to other areas without a local test centre where there is a significant demand, as well as suitable routes and venues.

The trial will involve only practical car tests; theory test centres will not be affected.",7/25/2011,managing-improving-and-investing-in-the-road-network,making-roads-safer,Driving Standards Agency,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,

'Find your nearest driving instructors' is available on Directgov. It lists fully qualified driving instructors who have signed up to be listed, and allows users to search for instructors closest to them by typing in their postcode.

Learners will also be able to see if an instructor has signed up to the voluntary code of practice and if they are committed to continuing their professional development. The voluntary code of practice sets out the professional standards and business ethics expected of those working in the industry. 

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>This new service will make life easier for learner drivers and parents looking for qualified instructors in their area. I hope that this will allow people to make more informed choices about who they want to teach them to drive.

Once qualified, approved instructors are tested regularly by DSA to ensure they are delivering the required standard of instruction, and are subject to ongoing enhanced criminal record checks. They display a green badge in their windscreen during lessons.

Trainee driving instructors will not be listed in the directory. However, trainee driving instructors can do a limited amount of teaching to gain experience and must display a pink badge in their windscreen to indicate that they are not yet fully qualified.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110630b,Dartford-Thurrock river crossing improvements,Roads Minister Mike Penning today launched a consultation about Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing improvements.,"Plans to tackle congestion at the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing and invest in major improvements have taken an important step forward as Roads Minister Mike Penning today launched a consultation into proposed charge increases.

The Minister also confirmed that tomorrow the Highways Agency will start a six-month trial of revised operational arrangements for suspending Dartford Crossing charges to help traffic flow when an emergency has created particularly severe congestion.

The Government is clear that reducing congestion at this vital transport link for the UK economy is an absolute priority.

To allow for the investment this needs the Government announced in last year's spending review that it intends to increase Dartford charges this year and next. Today the consultation has been launched into the proposed increases.

Mike Penning said: 

>The Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing is a vital piece of transport infrastructure that has brought huge economic benefits and opportunities to the country. But the simple fact is many more motorists want to use the Crossing than it was designed for and this leads to frequent lengthy delays, frustration and damage to the economy.

>Unless urgent action is taken this situation will only get worse with traffic expected to increase. That is unacceptable.

>It is clear that in the absence of the proposed increased revenues, we would not have been able to prioritise improvements which will benefit millions of road users. We are committed to introducing free flow charging to reduce congestion and explore provision of new additional crossing capacity. I also understand how frustrating it is when an emergency incident causes major delays around the Crossing. That is why from tomorrow the Highways Agency will trial new operational guidelines for suspending charges to help traffic flow when congestion is particularly severe.

Subject to consultation, the proposal is that cash payments would increase for cars from £1.50 to £2.00 in late 2011 and to £2.50 in spring 2012. For 2 axle goods vehicles cash payments would increase from £2.00 to £2.50 in late 2011 and to £3.00 in spring 2012. For heavy goods vehicles they would increase from £3.70 to £5.00 in late 2011 and to £6.00 in spring 2012. 

The Government recognises the important role of pre-payment in bringing about shorter transaction times and therefore intends maintaining the existing levels of discount for those paying in advance using the Dart-Tag system. 

The local residents' discount scheme will also be retained with no changes to the levels of charges. 

The public consultation will run until Friday 23rd September.

The revised operational arrangements for the suspension of charges will allow charges to be suspended in one or both directions, on a case by case basis, at times of defined levels of severe congestion.

During the trial, drivers will not be charged to use the Crossing if it is assessed that the suspension of the charge would help relieve the build-up of queues and congestion caused by an emergency situation.

**Notes to Editors**

1. A Written Ministerial Statement announcing the Dartford Crossing charge consultation was published today at:  
[www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110630](http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20110630)

2. A road user charge has been collected at the Crossing since 2003 using powers in the Transport Act 2000 with the purpose of managing the high demand for use of the Crossing. The Transport Act 2000 also provides that revenues from a road user charge must be spent on transport. 

3. The current charges have been in place since November 2008, which was the first time they were revised since their introduction as a road user charge in 2003. They are set out in the A282 Trunk Road (Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Charging Scheme) Order 2008 (Statutory Instrument 2008/1951. 

4. The Department for Transport announced its intention to consult on increased Crossing charges in the context of the outcome of the spending review in October 2010. See press release at: [http://nds.coi.gov.uk/clientmicrosite/Content/Detail.aspx?ClientId=202&NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=416118&SubjectId=36](http://nds.coi.gov.uk/clientmicrosite/Content/Detail.aspx?ClientId=202&NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=416118&SubjectId=36) 

5. New charges require the making of a new charging order in accordance with the procedural requirements set out  in Trunk Road Charging Schemes (Bridges and Tunnels)(England) Procedure Regulations 2001 (Statutory Instrument 2001/2303)

6. Accordingly a notice has been placed in the London Gazette, Thurrock Gazette and Dartford Messenger. In addition, the Department has made the relevant documents available for public inspection at the offices or Thurrock and Dartford councils and on the web at:  
[www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-08](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-08)

7. The proposed charge rates are set out in the table below: 

| Dartford Crossing Day Charges (6am-10pm) Note: no charges apply 10pm-6am  |
| | Current | Proposed | |
| | | 2011 | 2012 |
| Motorbikes | Free | Free | Free |
| Cash charge | | | |
| Cars | £1.50 | £2.00 | £2.50 |
| 2 Axle Goods | £2.00 | £2.50 | £3.00 |
| Multi Axle Goods | £3.70 | £5.00 | £6.00 |
| Dart-Tag charge | | | |  
| Cars | £1.00 | £1.33 | £1.67 |
| 2 Axle Goods | £1.75 | £2.19 | £2.63 |
| Multi Axle Goods | £3.20 | £4.33 | £5.19 |

8. The current protocol to suspend the charge is only implemented in exceptional emergency circumstances to facilitate the safe movement of traffic or in the interests in the safety of the public, in accordance with the Transport Act 2000 (section 172A). 

9.  The revised arrangements which are being trialled for six months from July 1 2011 set out the conditions which have to exist for a senior HA official to consider whether the Dartford Crossing charge can be suspended on a case by case basis. The conditions are that there has been or is likely to be an emergency situation, where continuous queues extend back - or have the potential to extend back - to the junctions 4 or 28 of the M25 or beyond, and where the suspension of the charge would ease the congestion and assist in managing the emergency situation. 

10. Until now the exceptional emergency decision to suspend charges has been made by a senior HA official based on their judgement of the network performance and their assessment of the emergency situation. The trial arrangement will look to provide greater clarity in formalising those procedures. 

11. The six month trial will allow HA to examine how successfully the arrangements operates and gain further knowledge of the costs and benefits in dealing with emergency situations.

12. During any Charge suspension, the barriers continue in their 'nodding' operation. This enables safe traffic flow control into the northbound tunnels and over the QEII bridge and is faster to implement.

13. Details of the operational arrangement to be trialled can be found at: [http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4065.aspx](http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4065.aspx)

DSA's chief executive Rosemary Thew said:

>Not all examiners are members of the PCS union and even if they are, we cannot be sure that they will not turn up for work. We therefore want candidates to attend so that practical tests can be delivered if possible. Theory tests are not affected and will be taking place as planned.

>Candidates who turn up but are unable to take their tests because of industrial action will not have to contact DSA to re-book. They should hear from us with a new date within five to ten working days. We apologise for the inconvenience this will cause and will do everything we can to minimise disruption for our customers.

If no examiner is available for a test, a new date will be rebooked automatically by DSA and the candidate will be sent details of the new test. If candidates fail to attend they will not be able to claim out-of-pocket expenses if their tests are cancelled and they will need to rebook their own tests.

DSA's customer service centre for practical tests might also be affected by the strike action. Customers who wish to book a practical test will still be able to use DSA's internet booking service at [direct.gov.uk/drivingtest.](http://www.direct.gov.uk/drivingtest)

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110626,New transparency rules for speed cameras,Full information about speed cameras will be published by local authorities and the police for the first time.,"Full information about speed cameras will be published by local authorities and the police for the first time, Road Safety Minister Mike Penning announced today.

Figures showing the numbers of accidents and casualties at camera sites - both before and after cameras were installed - will be published by local authorities.

And police forces will publish the number of speeding prosecutions arising from each camera in their area, as well as force-wide information about whether offenders are fined, complete a speed awareness course or are taken to court.

Mike Penning said:

>We want to improve accountability and make sure that the public are able to make informed judgements about the decisions made on their behalf. So if taxpayers' money is being spent on speed cameras then it is right that information about their effectiveness is available to the public.

>That is why we want full details of accidents and casualties at camera sites, along with the number of offences arising from each camera, to be easily accessible. This will help to show what impact cameras are having on road safety and also how the police are dealing with offenders.

English highway authorities are required to either publish or ensure publication of site by site casualty, collision and speed information for permanent fixed camera sites as soon as practical, and should provide the website address to the Department by 20th July. 

The information should usually include annual collision and casualty data back to 1990 for the numbers of killed and seriously injured people and for all personal injuries. Local authorities which support camera enforcement financially should also ensure that a deployment strategy is published.  

The Department will set up a central hub providing links to local websites where the information is published. 

The Highways Agency will publish site by site casualty, collision and speed information for permanent fixed camera sites on its network or provide links to where such sites are being included in what local authorities are publishing.

Police forces are to publish the number of prosecutions arising from each permanent or long term temporary fixed camera site in their area each year, along with the total number of offences recorded by all cameras and the total numbers of offenders given a fixed penalty notice, or taken to court and the numbers of people opting to complete speed awareness courses.

## Notes to editors

1. The Department for Transport set up a working group to advise on the publication of speed camera information. The group's report is published here:  
[http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/speed-camera-information](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/speed-camera-information) along with a covering note from the Department.

2. The Department has accepted the advice of the report of a working group about the publication of information related to speed cameras except in a few areas related to offence data 

3. The Department has today written to English highway authorities setting out the requirements identified by the working group for publication of accident, casualty and speed data. This is further to work co-ordinated by Communities and Local Government on local government accountability to produce a rationalised list of central government data requirements from local government in 2011-12. This data is amongst those councils are required to publish locally to facilitate local accountability, but which they are not required to submit to central government.  

4. In London the responsible organisation is Transport for London.

5. In relation to offence data the Department considers there is a strong justification in terms of public transparency and accountability to publish this information site by site for fixed camera sites. So, following further dialogue with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), site by site offence data is to be published.

6. Annual numbers of prosecutions are to be published by police forces (or other organisations on their behalf) site by site for permanent, and long term (more than six months) temporary, fixed speed camera sites. Total numbers of prosecutions/planned prosecutions arising from camera enforcement (whether fixed or mobile) in a year and the disposal method (for example via training, fixed penalty notices or court summons) are to be published by police force area and, where practicable and cost effective, at the local highway authority scale.   

7. The Department will review the position related to implementation of the publication of speed camera information after six months with ACPO and the working group.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110617,Drivers urged to THINK! biker in bid to cut road deaths,A new THINK! campaign to help cut the number of motorcyclists killed and injured on Britain's roads began today.,"A new THINK! campaign to help cut the number of motorcyclists killed and injured on Britain's roads was launched today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.

Despite accounting for only 1% of traffic, motorcyclists make up around 20% of deaths on Britain's roads with many of these collisions happening at junctions and involving another vehicle. This campaign will put motorcyclists centre stage in a bid to encourage drivers to look out for bikers by placing the focus on the person behind the helmet.

Mike Penning said:

>Britain has some of the safest roads in the world but around nine motorcyclists were still killed on the roads each week in 2009. 

>As a biker I know how much fun motorcycling can be and what a practical way it is to get around, but it is unacceptable that so many motorcyclists are dying on our roads and I want to tackle this.

>While many drivers may take extra care at junctions, they often don't see bikers and this is a major factor in motorcycle casualties.  That is why our THINK! campaign aims to remind drivers to think about the biker, not just the bike, so that we see fewer of these needless accidents.

In 2009, 78% of motorcyclists killed and seriously injured were in collisions involving another vehicle and 67% of these collisions occurred at junctions, often with the driver of the other vehicle failing to see the motorcycle.

The THINK! campaign will include national radio adverts which will run from Monday 20th June which will be supported by drive time radio sponsorship and nationwide petrol forecourt advertising. There will also be Facebook activity aimed at motorcyclists and online adverts reminding drivers to look out for bikers.

THINK! will also be working with partners to raise awareness of extra training for motorcyclists and the importance of wearing appropriate safety gear when riding. 

## Notes to editors

  1. The total cost of the THINK! motorcycles campaign for 2011/12 is £1.2 million.
  2. Motorcyclists have the highest fatality rate per billion mile of any road user group. Despite only representing 1% of vehicle traffic, they account for around 20% of all road user deaths in Great Britain. 472 motorcyclists died and 5,350 were seriously injured in road accidents in 2009.
  3. Typically around three-quarters (75%) of motorcycle deaths and serious injuries occur in collisions involving another vehicle.

Transport Minister Norman Baker and Economic Secretary to the Treasury Justine Greening today launched the second phase of the Government's Humber Bridge review.

The review will explore options for reform and consider the views of local residents and businesses, local authorities, MPs and the Humber Bridge Board.

Meanwhile the Government has agreed to continue to offer a reduced interest rate on the Humber Bridge Board's debt which will save the board £48m over the next five years.

The Department for Transport has also agreed the Public Inquiry Inspector's recommendation to approve the Humber Bridge Board's application to increase the Bridge tolls.

Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Justine Greening, said:

>I welcome the beginning of the next phase of the Humber Bridge Review. When I visited the Humber Bridge in January I saw first-hand just how essential this bridge is for the local community and businesses.

>But a long-term sustainable solution is needed and this is why the Chancellor and I are working alongside the Department for Transport to look at options to deliver this essential reform.

Today sees the publication of the Terms of Reference of the second phase of the review. The first phase of the review involved an independent economic appraisal of the impact of the toll level. The Government will consider the economic assessment, the results of the second phase of the review and the current financial situation before making an announcement in November 2011.

Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>The Government fully recognises the importance of the Humber Bridge to the economy and communities of the Humber area. That is why we are today starting the second phase of the Government's review and have also announced a new interest rate offer which will save the Bridge Board around £48m.

>The Humber Bridge Board applied to increase the tolls and it was the Department's duty to consider that proposal. The independent inspector came down firmly in favour of the board's proposals and we did not feel it would be right to overrule that advice. However, by pushing ahead with the Government's review I hope we will be able to help the region and bridge owners find a long term sustainable way forward for this important transport link.

### Notes to editors

1. The Terms of Reference for the Humber Bridge Review are as follows:

Aims of the review

  * To explore the impact of the bridge on the local economy and the value for money case for change.
  * To ensure the review considers the views of the local community, business leaders, local councils, the Bridge Board and local MPs.
  * To set out an affordable and long term sustainable solution for repaying the Humber Bridge debt.
  * To explore possible reforms to the governance structure, considering a variety of models, to support effective local management of the bridge and accountability to the local community.

Criteria against which options will be considered

  * Value for money;
  * Affordability of proposed changes in the context of the wider economic position;
  * Risk of proposals to sensitivities, including changes in traffic flows and maintenance spend;
  * Deliverability;
  * Best practice principles set out in _Managing Public Money_;
  * Carbon emissions and other environmental impact;
  * Wider policy implications.

2. The arrangement under which the interest rate on the debt owed by the Humber Bridge Board to the Government was reduced from 7.75% to 4.25% expired in March 2011. The Government has now agreed to extend the arrangement for a further five years from April 2011. A statutory instrument giving legal force to this agreement will be laid in Parliament in the near future.

3. The Humber Bridge Board applied to the Secretary of State for Transport to increase the tolls on the Humber Bridge and a public inquiry was held on 8-10 March 2011. The increase, the first approved since 2006, will be 11%, which is in line with general price inflation over the period. The Inspector recommended that the Humber Bridge Board's application be approved, and the Secretary of State today accepted his recommendations. The decision letter and the Inspector's Report have been published today and can be downloaded from the [Department for Transport website](/publications/humber-bridge-act-201106/).

The schedule of new toll charges approved today is as follows:

| Class of Traffic | Existing Toll | Proposed Toll | |
| 1. | Motorcycle (with or without sidecar) | £1.20 | £1.30 |
| 2. | Motor car, Motor caravan, Goods vehicles having a maximum weight not exceeding 3.5 tonnes | £2.70 | £3.00 |
| 3. | Goods vehicles having a maximum weight exceeding 3.5 tonnes but not exceeding 7.5 tonnes, Vehicle in Class 2 above with trailer, Small bus (up to 16 passengers excluding driver) | £4.90 | £5.40 |
| 4. | Goods vehicles exceeding 7.5 tonnes maximum weight with two axles, Large buses | £10.90 | £12.10 |
| 5. | Goods vehicles exceeding 7.5 tonnes maximum weight with three axles | £14.60 | £16.20 |
| 6. | Goods vehicles exceeding 7.5 tonnes maximum weight with four or more axles | £18.30 | £20.30 |
| 7. | Any other vehicle using the Bridge and not specifically identified in the above Classification shall be charged a toll by reference to the vehicle's maximum gross vehicle weight and number of axles.  The toll charged for the vehicle shall not exceed the toll specified at 2 to 6 for a vehicle with the same maximum vehicle weight and number of axles | | |
| 8. | Pedestrians | Nil | Nil |
| 9. | Pedal Cycles | Nil | Nil |

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110609,Ministers cut traffic signs red tape for local councils ,Measures to reduce time-consuming and costly bureaucracy for councils wanting to use 20 mph schemes were announced today.,"Measures to reduce time-consuming and costly bureaucracy for councils wanting to use 20 mph schemes were announced today by Regional and Local Transport Minister Norman Baker. 

Today's changes - the first to be announced as part of the Traffic Signs Policy Review - will mean that councils can use signs painted on roads as an alternative to expensive upright signs, cutting street clutter as well as costs. 

In addition, the Government will reduce the need for councils to use speed humps in 20 mph zones and make it cheaper and easier for councils to put in place variable speed limits outside schools when local residents want these schemes. 

Norman Baker said:

>I want to end the era of top-down government by providing a radical devolution of power to local authorities and communities.

>If councils and local communities want to put in place 20 mph schemes on residential roads or use common-sense measures such as variable speed limits outside schools, then they should be able to do so without spending time and money satisfying unnecessary Whitehall diktats. 

>These changes will reduce costs for councils wanting to use 20 mph schemes, allowing them to act faster in response to the needs of their local residents while still ensuring that drivers know what speed they should drive at.

The changes include:

  * Expanding the list of specified traffic calming measures allowable in 20 mph zones to include repeater signs and mini-roundabouts. This would allow zones to be introduced with fewer road humps or chicanes where appropriate;

  * Allowing local authorities to use speed limit symbols painted on roads more often as repeater signs in 20 mph zones and limits. Upright signs will still be required to indicate the start and end of 20 mph schemes.

  * Allowing local authorities to place signs at the entry and exit of variable speed limits - e.g. outside schools - on only one side of the road rather than on both sides of the road as is currently the case;

  * Allowing the use of either flashing warning lights or specified flashing lights with a static sign at the entry to variable speed limits which are cheaper for councils to buy; 

  * Allowing the use of a sign design for advisory 20 mph limits using flashing school warning lights. 

  * Councils will now be able to request council-wide authorisations for these measures to be used in 20 mph schemes on residential roads where cost-benefit analysis has shown that such schemes would be worthwhile. This will mean that councils can apply these measures without getting approval from Government in each case.

It remains the decision of local councils to decide whether or not to use 20 mph schemes following robust cost-benefit analysis of any such proposals.

The Traffic Signs Policy Review is due to publish its final report later this summer. 

In addition, the Department for Transport plans to revise the guidance on speed limits with the aim of increasing flexibility for local authorities. The Department will provide an economic tool to help them to assess the full costs and benefits of any proposed schemes so that they can use measures which are both appropriate and good value for money.

**Notes to editors**  

1. Local authorities are able to use their power to introduce 20 mph speed schemes in (a) major streets where business on foot is more important than slowing down road traffic and (b) lesser residential roads in cities, towns and villages, particularly where this would be reasonable for the road environment, there is community support and streets are being used by pedestrians and cyclists. Evidence suggests that in residential streets, and in town centres where there is likely to be a conflict between vehicles and pedestrians, carefully implemented 20 mph zones can contribute to an improvement in road safety. 

2. The strategic road safety framework, published on 11th May 2011, announced plans to revise and reissue the DfT guidance on speed limits in urban areas with the aim of increasing flexibility for local authorities.

3. It also indicated that the DfT will provide a toolkit to help local authorities assess the full costs and benefits of proposed schemes. This should help them make robustly defensible decisions about speed limits.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110609a,More London boroughs sign up for street works permit schemes ,A scheme giving councils greater power to co-ordinate works on their roads will extend into a further seven London boroughs.,"A scheme which gives councils greater power to co-ordinate works on their roads will extend into a further seven London boroughs after they received the go-ahead by Regional and Local Transport Minister Norman Baker today.

Greenwich, Harrow, Lambeth, Newham, Richmond, Southwark and Waltham Forest have all been successful in their application to run road works permit schemes. The schemes will allow the boroughs to require anyone carrying out road works to apply for a permit in advance and to set conditions on timing, coordination or the amount of road space to be left available to road users during the works. Those companies who break the terms of their permit or work without a permit can be fined.

The London Permit Scheme has run since January 2010 and today's approvals will see a further seven boroughs join it.

Regional and Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>Everyone who lives and works in London has experienced the frustration of having their journey disrupted by road works and I want to see councils and utility companies doing all they can to reduce the problems works cause for the travelling public.
 
>That is why I am pleased that these seven councils are now able to join the London Permit Scheme and hope this will bring real benefits to more Londoners.""

Last month the Department for Transport and Transport for London announced a joint £1million research project to examine innovative engineering techniques which could see utilities use temporary road surfacing methods and fast-setting replacement road surfaces. This would allow more work to be carried out at quieter times and for roads to be re-opened during peak traffic periods.

**Notes to editors**

1. Permit schemes are currently in place in: City of London, Westminster City Council, The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London Boroughs of Barnet, Brent, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Hackney, Hammersmith & Fulham, Haringey, Hounslow, Islington, Lewisham, Redbridge, Wandsworth and across the TfL network.

2. Outside London, Kent and Northamptonshire have put schemes in place.

3. Other local authorities currently drawing up plans for permit schemes are Common Permit Scheme (East of England), Greater Manchester Roads Activity Permit Scheme (GMRAPS), Merseyside Authorities Permit Scheme (MAPS) and Yorkshire Common Permit Scheme.

The error affects the A428 which was identified in the statistics release as a poor performing route.

Some of the data for sections of the A428 has now been found to be faulty; this contributed to the artificially low reliability figures for the A428 up to February 2011, which we do not believe reflect the actual journey times on the route. We are urgently reviewing our data checking procedures to establish why this error was not identified earlier and ensure this does not happen again.

However, because there was an error in one of the detailed routes all individual routes have been withdrawn for further checks. We will reinstate this data as soon as possible.

The move sees approximately sixty-five miles of the A1 join a key list of nationally important roads.

It is part of the Government's move to ensure the economic importance of routes from England to the capital cities of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are properly recognised.

A number of roads linking Bootle with Twelve Quays Ferry Terminal in Birkenhead, Merseyside, will also become a route of strategic national importance. This is because it is the main passenger and freight ferry terminal for traffic travelling between Liverpool and Belfast.

Norman Baker said:

>The important changes I am announcing today will ensure the economic importance of routes from England to Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff are properly recognised.

>The changes are of particular significance for the A1 north of Newcastle where campaigners have long fought to have the route recognised as being of national importance. 

>While it does not guarantee funding - any proposed upgrade would need to be subject to the usual decision making processes - it finally recognises the road's importance for freight and other strategic traffic travelling between Newcastle and Edinburgh.

In 2009 fourteen Strategic National Corridors (SNCs) were identified by the Department for Transport - recognising the economic importance of road and rail routes linking the largest English cities with the busiest ports and airports in England. 

However, the criteria set out at that time did not specify that key road and rail routes providing links between Newcastle and Edinburgh, Liverpool and Belfast or Bristol and Cardiff should be included.

In practice Cardiff is linked to Bristol via the M4 and M48, which are already recognised as routes of strategic national importance. But Edinburgh and services to Belfast were unconnected to SNCs by road, and today's changes rectify this. 

A number of other changes to the SNCs were proposed by consultation respondents, including extensions to the SNCs which would affect Norfolk, Devon and Kent. Ministers will not make a final decision on the scope and role of the SNCs until the Local Enterprise Partnerships - and their role in transport decision making - are fully established. 

## Notes to Editors

1. A [Written Ministerial Statement](http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/baker-20110523) was published today. 
2. The [consultation ](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2010-33/) closed on Friday 10 December. In total 63 responses were sent directly to the Department.
3. As a result of the changes two additional routes will be recognised in future as being of national strategic importance
4. The A1 north of Newcastle - between its junction with the A19 at Seaton Burn - to the Scottish border (providing a defined link to Edinburgh)
5. Approximately nine miles of Local Authority controlled roads between Bootle and Twelve Quays Ferry Terminal in Birkenhead, including part of the A565 and the Kingsway Tunnel (providing connectivity with Belfast). 
6. The full route is as follows: 
    * A565 from junction with A5036 in Bootle to A5063 ""Leeds Street""; then
    * A5063 ""Leeds Street"" from junction with A565 to A59 ""Scotland Road""; then
    * A59 ""Scotland Road"" to ""Kingsway Tunnel""; then ""Kingsway Tunnel"" to grade separated junction with A5027; then
    * A5027 to junction with A5139; then
    * A5139 to A554; then
    * A554 to Twelve Quays Terminal entrance
7. The A1 north of Newcastle is currently a Highways Agency (HA) 'regional' road. It will now become a HA 'national' road, and this will be taken into account in decision-making and planning from this point forward. 
8. The route identified in Merseyside will not be added to the trunk road network. Responsibility for day-to-day operational decisions, maintenance and improvement will remain with the relevant local Highway Authorities (either Sefton, Liverpool or Wirral councils, or for the Kingsway Tunnel, Merseytravel). The Secretary of State will, however, maintain a watching interest in the route and its effectiveness in providing strategic connectivity. 
9. A number of proposals for changing the scope of the SNCs were received. These included requests that they be extended to Plymouth and Norwich, and that a second SNC be extended to Dover. The Department intends to revisit the scope of the SNCs, as well as their exact role in decision-making, once the Local Enterprise Partnerships are fully established and their role in transport decision-making is clear.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110523b,Motorists warned to get insured ahead of crackdown ,New crackdown to tackle the menace of uninsured driving.,"Motorists are being warned to insure their vehicles ahead of a new crackdown to tackle the menace of uninsured driving.

Under the new Continuous Insurance Enforcement law - which will affect all motorists from June 20 - it is an offence to keep an uninsured vehicle, rather than just to drive when uninsured.

A national advertising campaign will be launched by the Motor Insurers' Bureau today to raise awareness of the law. 

Road Safety Minister Mike Penning said:

>Uninsured drivers are a danger on our roads, killing 160 and injuring a further 23,000 people each year, and they cost honest motorists £500 million in extra premiums. That is why we are introducing this tough new law which will leave uninsured drivers with nowhere to hide. 

>Our message is clear - get insured or face a fine, court action or seeing your car seized and destroyed.

Ashton West, Chief Executive at the Motor Insurers' Bureau, said: 

>The change in law is a stepping up of enforcement activity, so that not only those vehicles driven without insurance will be caught. Now the registered keeper must make sure that their vehicle is insured all the time.

>In order to make sure everyone is aware of the new scheme, a national awareness campaign will be shown on satellite and terrestrial TV channels.

>Around four percent of vehicles have no motor insurance at any given time, and this needs to change so that is why this new enforcement approach is so important.

Under the new system:

  * The DVLA will work in partnership with the Motor Insurers' Bureau to identify uninsured vehicles. 
  * Motorists will receive a letter telling them that their vehicle appears to be uninsured and warning them that they will be fined unless they take action. 
  * If the keeper fails to insure the vehicle they will be given a £100 fine. 
  * If the vehicle remains uninsured - regardless of whether the fine is paid - further action will be taken. If the vehicle is on public land it could then be clamped, seized and destroyed. Alternatively court action could be taken, with the offender facing a fine of up to £1,000. 
  * Seized vehicles would only be released when the keeper provided evidence that the registered keeper is no longer committing an offence of having no insurance and the person proposing to drive the vehicle away is insured to do so. 

Vehicles with a valid Statutory Off Road Notice (SORN) will not be required to be insured.

The new law will run alongside the existing offence of using a vehicle with no insurance, which is enforced by the police. The police seize 180,000 vehicles each year for this offence, and offenders also face a £200 fixed penalty or a court fine of up to £5,000 and possible disqualification. 

The DVLA's records will be compared regularly with the Motor Insurance Database (MID) and this process will identify registered keepers of vehicles that appear to have no insurance. All drivers can check their vehicle is recorded on the [Motor Insurance Database ](http://www.askMID.com)for free  


## Notes to editors 

  * Latest estimates are that around 4% (around 1.4 million) of GB motorists drive uninsured. The penalty for driving without insurance is a maximum fine of £5,000 and six to eight penalty points or possible disqualification. Around 200,000 offenders are convicted for uninsured driving every year.
  * Currently every responsible motorist pays an average £30 each year within their premiums to cover crashes involving uninsured and untraced drivers. It is also estimated that uninsured and untraced drivers kill 160 people and injure 23,000 every year.
  * Measures already introduced in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 gave police improved access to the Motor Insurance Database and powers to seize vehicles driven without insurance. In 2009 around 180,000 uninsured vehicles were seized.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110520,Your chance to cut motoring red tape,Your chance to reduce the number of badly thought out and obsolete motoring regulations. ,"Life is about to get easier for road users, businesses, and local authorities as Roads Minister Mike Penning today pledged to slash unnecessary red tape. 

Over 400 Whitehall road transport regulations have been placed on the [Red Tape Challenge website](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/) - a Government-wide site aimed at reducing bureaucracy - for four weeks. It asks everyone whether they think that a regulation is well-designed and provides vital protections, or is badly designed, badly implemented or simply a bad idea. 

Prime candidates for being scrapped include:

  * The requirement for motorists to have a paper or electronically issued motor insurance certificate. Getting rid of this requirement could reduce admin costs for businesses and cut bureaucracy for many people;
  * Regulations specifying that bus companies have to wait 48 hours before they can throw away perishable items that have been left on the bus;
  * Rules specifying the procedure that councils must go through when installing speed humps. This includes the minimum (and maximum) heights and the minimum number of lights that must be installed nearby.

Mike Penning said;

>We are calling on everyone: consumers, businesses and volunteer groups to get involved and help reduce the number of badly thought out and obsolete regulations in our country. 

>Is it right that we tell car owners they must have a bit of paper to prove they have insured their car? Or that a bus company has to keep the box of eggs you left on the bus for a full two days before they can throw them away? And what about us telling your local authority how high and long a speed bump should be? Enough of the form filling!

>By getting government off people's backs we can free businesses to compete, create jobs and unleash a private sector-led recovery. We will also give people the opportunity to play a greater role in their community and build a stronger society.""

The review also targets a number of arcane and obsolete regulations on the statute books that could run the risk of eroding public confidence in regulations. For example, there are regulations in force dating back to the 2007 foot and mouth crisis allowing milk tanker drivers to work longer hours. There are also regulations that still exist allowing road closures for the 1994 Tour de France.

Experienced 'sector champions' will be providing expert knowledge during the Red Tape Challenge on the issues faced by those on the shop floor.

Motorists' champion Edmund King, AA president and Visiting Professor of Transport at Newcastle University, said:

>Good road transport should be about getting from A to B in an efficient, economic, safe, and sustainable manner. It should not be about filling in forms from A to Z or complying with historic, bureaucratic, and irrelevant regulations. The AA supports this initiative to cut red tape whilst maintaining a flexible framework to enable safe and reliable journeys.""

Freight champion Theo de Pencier, CEO of the Freight Transport Association, said:

>There are few industries as tightly regulated as the freight industry, so cutting those regulations that are clearly superfluous, pointless and downright barmy will allow companies in the sector to focus on doing their job properly in as safely and efficiently a manner as possible, saving time and cost in the process.""

Car lease and rental champion John Lewis, Chief Executive of the British Vehicle Rental & Leasing Association said;

>In the recent past the UK has had some prolific legislators in Government who spent far too much time and energy using legislation to place overbearing controls on the UK Motorist with a never ending stream of regulations that stayed in place for years even if their original purpose was out-dated.

>This Challenge gives people and businesses a four week opportunity to challenge what they believe is transport red tape and to put forward logical arguments for removing unnecessary and irrelevant regulations, which will get listened to. Let's make the most of it.""

The overall aim is to remove barriers to economic growth and increase individual freedoms. The presumption is that regulations will go, unless it can be justified why a regulation should be kept.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110519,Tackling £1billion cost of motorway closures ,Driving down the cost of motorway closures.,"A Government strategy to tackle congestion caused by motorway closures and drive down the £1 billion annual cost to the economy was unveiled today by Roads Minister, Mike Penning, ahead of a national summit.

The Minister also announced the launch of a £3 million fund for police forces to purchase laser scanning technology to speed up of the investigation process and incident clear up times. 

At a high-level summit in London today, the Roads Minister, Home Office, Highways Agency (HA) and police, fire and ambulance chiefs will commit to a 10 point action plan.

This will help ensure that closures take place only when they are absolutely necessary and for the minimum amount of time. This will help keep traffic moving, supporting economic growth for the future prosperity of the country. 

It follows a joint review of investigation and closure procedures for motorway incidents - led by the Department for Transport, working in partnership with the Home Office, HA and Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) - published today on the DfT website.

Mike Penning said:

>There is nothing more frustrating than being stuck in a traffic jam for hours on end. But even worse than that is the shocking £1 billion cost of those lost hours for our economy. That is why we are determined to improve clear-up times following accidents so we can get our motorways re-opened as quickly as possible. 

>Last year there were more than 18,000 full or partial motorway closures lasting a total of more than 20,000 hours. I recognise that, where serious incidents have occurred, closures on the motorway may be needed to ensure the safety of those at the scene and the travelling public. I also understand the importance of ensuring a safe and effective investigation. 

>However, I believe much more can be done to ensure incidents are managed effectively, efficiently and consistently.

>I am also pleased to announce DfT funding of around £3million for laser scanning technology that can be used by the police for surveying incident scenes. Recent trials by the police and HA have demonstrated that this can make a real difference in speeding up the investigation process.

Chief Constable Phil Gormley (ACPO lead for Roads Policing) said:

>This review has highlighted a number of innovative ways in which such closures can be minimised. The national summit will enable that process to begin, streamlining the response to such disruption.

>We will continue to work closely with Government and all those involved to ensure that the right balance is struck between conducting a thorough and comprehensive investigation whilst enabling our critical motorway infrastructure to return to normal as soon as possible.

The 10 point action plan, being formally agreed today, will see:

  * ACPO, in consultation with other incident management responders, review the Road Death Investigation Manual to ensure it strikes an appropriate balance between carrying out a thorough investigation of an incident and keeping traffic moving.
  * DfT/HA and ACPO explore the use of new technology to help speed up incident management, including consideration of the wider roll out of laser scanners to police forces and identifying/assessing future technologies.
  * Police training revised to improve officers' understanding around the impacts that lengthy closure procedures can have on road users and the economy.
  * Regular multi-agency training exercises to test a wide range of motorway closure scenarios carried out - and best practice guidance developed from this.
  * Particular focus given to examining the factors which contribute to long delays - and developing guidance to ensure motorways are not closed any longer than necessary.
  * DfT explore the role of police, fire, ambulance, HA staff and recovery agents in more detail to identify and agree specific issues which need to be addressed to improve incident durations.
  * The HA carry out further analysis to help understand the causes of regional variations in motorway closure durations and see what lessons can be learnt. 
  * The HA examine how it can improve the information it provides to road users to alert them to incidents - and provide better journey advice to keep queues to a minimum.
  * A new performance monitoring framework introduced and performance data on incident durations and clear up times published to track progress over time.
  * Best practice case studies regularly developed by the HA and shared with all incident management responders.

A large proportion of the recommendations will be delivered by the end of this year, with the remainder by the end of 2012. This will help to ensure that real changes can start to be made as soon as possible.

Work has already begun on the detailed planning and scoping of the work needed to implement each recommendation. A steering group will be established to ensure continued commitment to and progress on developing and implementing the recommendations. 

##  Notes to editors 

1. Review: [Joint review of investigation and closure procedures for motorway incidents ](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/investigation-and-closure-procedures-for-motorway-incidents)
2. The review was completed in January 2011 in line with the DfT Business Plan commitment.
3. A further [DfT Business Plan commitment](http://www.dft.gov.uk/about/publications/business/plan2011-15/pdf/plan2011-2015.pdf) to have implemented measures to reduce congestion caused by incidents by December 2012
4. The figure of the cost to the economy is a best estimate presented for indicative purposes only, to demonstrate the scale of the issue. It has been derived using basic calculations from the number of closure incidents (over 18,000) which occurred in 2009/10 and available incident data from 2010/11. It has also been cross referenced with previous estimates which have outlined that the total cost of congestion on the Highways Agency network is £3 billion, 25 per cent of which is caused by incidents. Going forward more work will need to be done to seek to produce a more directly correlated cost to actual incident durations
5. Further guidance and details on accessing the grant fund will be outlined for police forces in due course. 
6. Those formally agreeing the action plan at today's summit are as follows:  
* Chief Constable Phil Gormley (ACPO Roads Policing Lead)  
* Graham Dalton, Chief Executive Highways Agency  
* Simon Sheldon -Wilson Director of Traffic Management - Highways Agency  
* Assistant Chief Fire Officer Peter Hazeldine Representing the Chief Fire Officers Association

The money will fund an 18-month project by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) to examine innovative engineering techniques which could see utilities use temporary road surfacing methods and fast-setting replacement road surfaces. This would allow utility companies to carry out more work at quieter times and re-open roads during peak traffic periods to reduce delays and disruption. 

Funding will be provided equally by the Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport for London (TfL). 

Secretary of State for Transport, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, said:

>Everyone knows how frustrating the delays caused by road works can be, which is why we want utilities and local authorities to be able to make the most of the technology available to help keep disruption to a minimum. 

>This project will investigate how innovative engineering can provide greater flexibility and allow more road works to be carried out at times when the travelling public will be least inconvenienced. 

>By using technology to its full effect, as well as making sure that local authorities across the country have the powers they need, I hope that we can see fewer needless jams caused by road works.

It was also confirmed today that work is progressing at the DfT on drafting regulations that would allow local authorities to run lane rental schemes. The Mayor has asked Transport for London to develop proposals for a targeted lane rental scheme on the capital's busiest roads at peak times. That would incentivise utilities and other companies to carry out road works during the less busy periods of the day to reduce their impact on the travelling public. 

Consultation on the new regulations and TfL's proposals for a lane rental scheme will take place over the summer and, if approved, regulations would be in place by the end of the year, allowing the Mayor to apply to have the country's first lane rental scheme up and running in London in the first half of 2012. 

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 

>Having a lane rental scheme in London will hugely contribute towards clearing unnecessary disruption from the capital's roads. Every company working on our roads wants to do so in the most cost effective way possible and lane rental will give them the clearest incentive to do so. But this is not about penalising utility companies. We want to help them work as efficiently as they can, which is why we will pay for the research of new technology so that they are able to carry out work as swiftly and with as little disruption as possible.

London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 

>I am delighted that London is set to be in a position to introduce a much needed lane rental scheme from early next year, and we continue to actively work with the Mayor and DfT to do so. The funds TfL and the DfT are making available to develop new construction techniques will ultimately contribute towards keeping more roads open during peak times while works are still carried out off-peak and during the night.

>Only 20 per cent of utility road works are currently carried out during off-peak hours on the most congested parts of the Transport for London Road Network, compared to over 70 per cent of TfL's work. By developing these new techniques to enable road works to be done more rapidly, we can make sure that this research meets the needs of all respective industries, and ultimately reduces disruption and congestion on the capital's major roads.

## Notes to Editors

  * The DfT is currently drafting regulations to allow local authorities to run lane rental schemes. Such schemes would require those who dig up the roads to pay a daily charge for each lane occupied during busy traffic periods. Subject to consultations, planned for the summer, and approvals for both the regulations and the Mayor's scheme, it is TfL's aspiration to introduce lane rental charges from Spring 2012. 
  * Roadworks count for 38 per cent of the capital's traffic delay and can cost London's economy almost £1 billion a year. 
  * In April 2009 the Mayor agreed a voluntary Code of Conduct for Roadworks with the five largest utility companies (BT Openreach, Thames Water, EDF Energy, Virgin Media and the National Grid) working in London that has already resulted in better managed roadworks. These were joined by Southern Gas Ltd on 25 February 2010. The six utility companies, along with TfL highway works, account for 94 per cent of all works carried across London. 
  * During the first six months of the Mayor's Code of Conduct for Roadworks, the number of roadworks taking place only outside of peak hours on the TfL road network more than doubled (compared to the same six months in the previous year), rising from 1,224 in May-October 2008 to 2,451 in May-October 2009 - helping to cut delays on London's roads. It also found that there has been a reduction in the number of works inspected that required improvement for safety reasons; and only a small number of sites were now failing to display standard information signage. In June 2010, the National Joint Utilities Group adopted the Mayor's Code of Conduct as a template for a national Code, which is evidence of London's leadership in this area. TfL and the Mayor of London is also working to sign all 33 London boroughs up to the Code by 2012, helping to ensure better management of roadwork on all of the capital's roads. 
  * TfL and 18 London boroughs currently operate a roadwork permitting scheme: City of London, Westminster City Council, The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London Boroughs of Barnet, Brent, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Hackney, Hammersmith & Fulham, Haringey, Hounslow, Islington, Lewisham, Redbridge and Wandsworth. In the period April 2010 - March 2011, TfL has granted around 48,000 permits, refused around 9,700 for varying reasons and prevented more than 1,300 days of disruption by working with the utilities to better coordinate their works on TfL's roads. These measures alone have helped reduce disruption from poorly planned and coordinated works. 
  * Following the success of the London Permit Scheme, a number of additional London boroughs have now agreed to sign up to introduce a permitting scheme on schemes across London to 27, which, together with TfL's network, would cover around 80 per cent of all roads in the Capital. 
  * TfL continues to discuss introducing a permitting scheme with the remaining six London boroughs, with a look to have all of the capital's roads signed up by 2012. 
  * Through the London Permit Scheme and the Mayor's Code of Conduct for Roadworks, TfL has helped to reduce the amount of disruption on London's roads caused by road works. So far this year, TfL has recorded a 21 per cent reduction in the level of serious and severe disruption occurring on the Transport for London network across London, compared to the same period last year, and has managed to save more than 1,300 days of disruption by better coordination of roadworks on the capital's busiest roads. 
  * For every 30 minutes Londoners travelled on our roads last year, on average, their journeys are 29 seconds faster today. Given that there are the equivalent of 10 million such car journeys made every day on the network, this means that London's drivers are cumulatively sitting in their cars for over 80,000 hours less every day.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110413b,Councils urged to tackle road works disruption ,Councils are being urge to coordinate road works and make utility companies abide by strict conditions. ,"Local authorities are being urged by Regional and Local Transport Minister, Norman Baker, to consider the use of permit schemes that help to reduce the disruption caused by road works.

Road works permit schemes give councils more power to coordinate road works and once a scheme is in place utility companies and local authorities must abide by strict conditions including time limits, coordination or the amount of road space to be left available to road users during the works. 

Anyone who breaks the terms of their permit or works without a permit could be prosecuted and face a fine of up to £5,000. 

The letter sent to councils today also outlines plans to make the permit scheme application process less bureaucratic and costly by allowing councils to introduce schemes without needing to seek approval from central government. 

Norman Baker said:

>Some road works are necessary to keep vital infrastructure running but they should be managed so that the public aren't constantly inconvenienced. 

>That is why I have written to councils today urging them to develop permit schemes to help them co-ordinate works and reduce the hassle and frustration caused by road works. 

>We are also working to make it easier for councils to use the powers at their disposal to cut road works disruption by cutting the red tape they need to get through to put permit schemes in place.

##  Notes to editors 

  * Street works permit schemes are currently in place in Kent, London, and Northamptonshire.
  * A council running a permit scheme is able to charge companies for providing a permit although any charge should cover the costs of administering the permit scheme and should not result in a surplus. 
  * t is a criminal offence to work without a permit. The maximum fine will be £5,000. It is also an offence to not meet a permit condition, for which the maximum fine is £2,500. Fixed Penalty Notices, as an alternative enforcement mechanism, can instead be given for working without a permit or not meeting a permit condition. 
  * Local councils are responsible for designing and consulting on their own scheme proposals. Under current legislation, permit schemes in England can be implemented only with the approval of the Secretary of State. Councils in England have been able to apply to the Department for Transport to run their own road works permit schemes since the relevant Regulations came into force in April 2008. The Department for Transport's business plan sets out the intention to end the need for central government approval of individual local authorities' permit schemes from April 2012. Legislative proposals to do this will require Parliamentary approval.

The review - to be led by Alan Cook, non-executive Chairman of the Highways Agency board - is one of a series of measures announced by the Department for Transport as part of the spending review settlement to ensure that the Highways Agency is structured in the best way to deliver effective services.

The terms of reference will see the review team consider whether England's network of motorways and major A roads could be more effectively operated, maintained and enhanced. The team will draw on expertise from across various sectors and organisations during the course of the review to provide guidance and feedback from outside government.

The review will formally get underway after Easter and Mr Cook will report his findings to the Transport Secretary in October.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>Given the current fiscal climate, it is essential that all parts of Government strive for greater efficiency while delivering effective, value for money services. The Strategic Road Network is crucial to keeping people, goods and services moving and it is vital that we consider whether we could improve how the network is operated, managed and enhanced. 

>The Highways Agency has already agreed to meet some very tough targets for efficiency improvements as part of the spending review settlement while continuing to tackle congestion through delivery of major road improvement schemes and making better use of the road network.

>The independent review will build on this by advising whether broader reform can generate better value for money while ensuring we deliver effective services which support economic growth, maintain high standards of safety and contribute to environmental objectives.

The terms of reference

The review will not be asked to consider the definition, size or shape of the strategic road network itself. Nor will it consider introducing national road pricing.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The work is to be taken forward by Alan Cook (non-executive Chairman, Highways Agency board). 
  * Mr Cook will be supported by a high level steering group, which will include representatives of the Highways Agency, DfT and HMT and will provide strategic direction.
  * Mr Cook was appointed as non executive Chairman of the Highways Agency on 10 January 2011.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110324b,Government doubles funding for pothole repairs ,More money for English highway authorities to repair potholes.,"Councils have today been told how they will benefit from the doubling of funding available for repairing potholes as announced in yesterday's Budget.

Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 has written to all English local highway authorities to inform them of their share of £200m.

Last month the Department for Transport announced that it was making available £100m as an exceptional payment to help with much needed road repairs following the severe weather at the end of last year. This extra funding was made possible because of savings the Department made earlier in the financial year.

However, further savings have now been identified and so more money has been made available for this vital programme.

Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>Potholes are a menace to all road users and I want councils to make fixing them a priority.

>That is why, when more funding became available, I agreed with the Chancellor that we would double the amount of money we are providing for repairs to be carried out.

>This represents a significant investment in road maintenance at a time of severe fiscal restraint, demonstrating the Government's commitment to maintain our infrastructure to support motorists and businesses.

The funding is in addition to the £831 million already provided to councils for road maintenance this year and the £3 billion the Government has committed over the next four years.

All 153 local highway authorities in England, including those in London, will receive a share of the funding. To ensure the money can be distributed over the next few days, the funds will be automatically distributed to English local authorities according to the formula used to distribute road maintenance funding rather than councils needing to apply for it. 

To promote greater transparency and accountability, all local highway authorities have agreed to publish information on their website by 30 September 2011 showing where this extra money has been spent.

###  Notes to editors 

  * The Department for Transport announced in a [  
press release](http://nds.coi.gov.uk/clientmicrosite/Content/Detail.aspx?ClientId=202&NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=418207&SubjectId=36) on 23rd February that councils in England would be given more than £100 million of extra funding to spend on repairing potholes.
  * The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced in yesterday's Budget that the total funding being made available is now £200m, which will be shared across all local highway authorities in England including London (please see allocations below).
  * As the damage caused by severe weather was widespread across the country and to minimise administrative burdens for all concerned, the funds will be distributed formulaically based on the Department's existing highways maintenance capital funding formula (which takes into account road length and condition). 
  * As part of this additional funding, the Department requires local highway authorities to publish a brief note on their website by 30 September 2011 for local communities to be able to see how this extra funding has been spent. In order to qualify for the funding, councils were required to confirm they accepted these conditions by 16 March 2011 and all 153 Local Transport Authorities agreed to do so.
  * This funding is being provided on an exceptional basis. It remains the responsibility of local councils to plan and manage their road maintenance programmes throughout the year, including appropriate winter resilience measures.

The funding is in addition to the £831 million already provided to councils for road maintenance this year and the £3 billion the Government has committed over the next four years.

The severe weather at the end of last year has left many local roads in a poor condition. Every local authority has a responsibility to properly maintain their roads, including planning winter resilience measures, but this exceptional weather has caused significant additional damage.

Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, said:

>Millions of motorists across the country have their daily drives ruined by potholes. And the awful winter weather we had this year is only going to make that problem worse.

>That is why, despite the tough financial position we are in, we are going to give councils over £100m extra to help carry out much needed repairs to England's roads. 

>I am determined to see the winter damage to our roads fixed as quickly as possible and we will be working with councils to make sure that happens.

>This money should make a real difference to the millions of drivers who are fed up with having to continually battle against dangerous potholes, giving them safer and smoother journeys.

To make sure that councils are able to make use of this money as soon as possible, the funds will be distributed to English local authorities based on the amount and condition of roads the authority is responsible for rather than councils needing to apply for the funding. 

The extra funding has been made possible because of savings the Department made earlier in the financial year. In order to qualify for this extra funding and to promote greater transparency and accountability, local authorities will need to publish information on their website by 30 September 2011 showing where this money has been spent.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110221,Freeing pedestrians from pavement parking blight ,Councils told to use their powers to prevent parking on the pavement where it is a problem and causing an obstruction.,"The Government is making it easier for councils to tackle pavement parking and stop it causing an obstruction to pedestrians, Regional and Local Transport Minister, Norman Baker, announced today. 

Vehicles parked on pavements can cause particular problems for people in wheelchairs or with visual impairments and those with pushchairs. The Minister has today written to councils prompting them to use their powers to prevent parking on the pavement where it is a problem.

Along with the letter, the Department for Transport has given all councils in England permission to use signs to indicate a local pavement parking ban. Until now councils have had to gain special signs authorisation from Government each time they want to put a pavement parking ban in place. 

While in some circumstances pavement parking is unavoidable - for example in narrow residential roads with no off-street parking - the Government believes that in many cases it can be avoided. Pavement parking is completely banned in London.

Norman Baker said:

>Parking on the pavement can be selfish and dangerous, putting pedestrians - especially those with disabilities or using pushchairs - in danger. If a vehicle is blocking the pavement then people often have no choice but to walk in the road where they are at much greater risk of being involved in an accident. 

>Most drivers are considerate and do not park on the pavement unless it is permitted or necessary. However, there is a selfish minority who do not use their common sense and dump their cars wherever it suits them without a second thought for others.

>I hope that reducing the bureaucracy involved in banning pavement parking will make it easier for councils to use their powers to tackle this nuisance and make life safer for everyone.

Dai Powell OBE, Chair of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee:

>Inconsiderate parking on pavements can stop disabled people from gaining access to services and can also put them at great risk if having to resort to using roads. This practice also damages pavements, causing trip hazards and costing local councils who have to undertake repairs. 

>DPTAC welcomes the move by the minister encouraging local councils to use their powers to enforce the law, freeing our pavements to make them accessible to all.""

## Notes to Editors

  * In most areas of England (outside London), any specific footway parking ban is applied locally and indicated by traffic signs. A local authority can make a traffic regulation order (TRO) to prohibit footway parking on a designated length of highway or over a wider area. This means the Council can target problem areas rather than applying a blanket ban.
  * Every English traffic authority has today been issued with the special authorisation necessary to use the appropriate signs. 
  * Local authorities with civil parking enforcement powers can enforce this ban along with the Road Traffic Act 1988 prohibition on heavy goods vehicles parking on the pavement. 
  * Pavement parking in London is banned by the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1974. 
  * Local authorities can use physical measures such as high kerbs or bollards to prevent vehicles mounting the footway where footway parking is a particular problem. Such measures have the advantage of being largely self-enforcing.
  * If you want to find out more, here is the Department's detailed advice on the design and application of pavement parking

The Government was concerned that DfT guidance - which was intended to cover all types of special event, not specifically street parties - was sometimes being misinterpreted by councils causing them to impose extra bureaucracy and costs on residents.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 will write to all local councils in England this week informing them that he is scrapping the guidance to avoid any confusion. The letter also reminds councils that providing information about closures need not mean unnecessary burdens on communities.

Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, said:

>The Royal Wedding will be a day of celebration for communities up and down the country and street parties are a great way for people to get together and share this happy occasion. 

>In the past our guidance to councils on road closures has sometimes been misinterpreted and led to residents facing escalating costs and unnecessary bureaucracy. 

>I hope that withdrawing this guidance will make it easier for councils to let street parties go ahead and allow local communities to celebrate without being bogged down by paperwork.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

>Whitehall has cut back the red tape which holds local community groups back. 

>Councils should now do their bit to support this national day of celebration. 

>This is as an opportunity for councils to help local residents from all backgrounds to come together, and reinforce our shared identity and sense of Britishness.

The Department for Communities and Local Government is also updating the Government's practical guide to organising street parties and fetes to help community groups organise these events in their local areas.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110201,New powers to help councils redraw the map ,Local authorities given greater control over how their roads appear on maps and satnav systems.,"Local authorities will be given greater control over how their roads appear on maps and satnav systems - helping them to better direct traffic - under bureaucracy-cutting proposals set out today by Local and Regional Transport Minister, Norman Baker.

At present, if a council wants to change the classification of one of its roads - for example downgrading an A road to a B road - it has to be approved by the Department for Transport. 

The Government proposes devolving decision making to councils as they are best-placed to decide the classification of local roads. This would help them make clear to drivers which roads are most suitable for through-journeys, potentially reducing congestion on local routes. 

Norman Baker said: 

>The current system dates back to the 1960s and is a hangover from the days of Whitehall-knows-best. I believe in giving power to local people. This reform will cut red tape and mean councils can better control traffic in their area.

>They can ensure A roads are placed where they want traffic to run, and can lower the category of road in places they want traffic to avoid. By making it less onerous for councils to ensure road classification better reflects conditions on the ground, journeys will be easier to navigate.

>We are also using this as an opportunity to invite new ideas of tackling some of the problems caused by satnavs, for example lorries being directed down unsuitable roads. We want to hear suggestions as to how the current system could be improved - and how councils could better work with satnav companies.

Under the new system, councils will have control over road classification decisions in their area - including which roads should be used as primary routes - with no requirement to get approval from the DfT. The Department will only deal with contentious cases where there are serious disagreements about a council's decision.

Local authorities will be required to send a formal record of any changes to its road network to DfT but reporting will be streamlined - with the current eight forms replaced with one. 

As part of the move to open up Government, for the first time policy about the road network and classification will be made available to the public. This will help motorists and communities to hold central and local government to account for their decisions.

This will also include our policies on detrunking and trunking - the process by which a local authority takes over a road from the Highways Agency (or vice versa). This will help explain why some roads are run nationally, and where they could be run locally. 

The [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-02/), published today on the DfT website, will be open until May.

###  Notes to editors 

  * At present, the Department for Transport must approve all changes to roads classification (whether a road is an A road, a B road, a minor road or an unclassified road) and all changes to the Primary Route Network (major A roads that are coloured green on most maps).
  * Under the new approach, local authorities would have responsibility for road classification in their area.
  * The Department would maintain a list of 'primary destinations', but local authorities would decide by which routes they are best connected, working together where necessary. 
  * The Department would remain responsible for the Strategic Road Network (motorways and major A-roads operated by the Highways Agency) in England.
  * The [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2011-02/)published today
  * Roads classification and the Primary Route Network are a devolved matter in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
  * The consultation also invites suggestions on how local and central Government can better co-ordinate with satnav companies.

Mr Cook has held senior positions in both the private and public sectors. He is a non-executive Board member at the Department for Transport and a non-executive Director of the Financial Ombudsman Service and of the Office of Fair Trading. He was formerly Managing Director of the Post Office, Chief Executive Officer of National Savings & Investments and Chief Operating Officer of Prudential.

Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, said:

>As part of the Spending Review Settlement, that saw a relatively generous capital allocation for Highways Agency projects, the Highways Agency has agreed to meet some very tough targets for efficiency improvements. 

>Alan Cook's experience as a board member of the Department for Transport and his extensive experience elsewhere, make him well placed to support the Highways Agency as it implements the changes required to deliver the agreed efficiencies during the spending review period.

As part of the spending review settlement the Department for Transport announced a series of measures to ensure that the Agency is structured in the best way to deliver effective services. The appointment of Mr Cook as a non-executive Chairman to the Agency Board is a crucial part of this process. 

Mr Cook said:

>""I am looking forward to taking on this role and working closely with HA chief executive Graham Dalton and his team. 

>""This is a challenging time for the public sector generally and the HA has some particularly difficult issues to work through as it seeks to maintain a high level of service for road users against a challenging public spending background."" 

Mr Cook's role will involve him agreeing the HA's performance measures for 2011-12 as part of the Agency's annual business plan. He will also provide valuable input to other measures, including agreeing the terms of reference for the independent review to determine whether the Government has the most appropriate approach to the operation, maintenance and enhancement of the strategic roads network.

Ministers will review the structure and governance of the Agency to see whether broader reform can generate even better value for money.

The Department for Transport has agreed to invest £23.8 million towards the new permanent arch bridge over the River Thames. This follows work by Surrey County Council to reduce the scheme costs resulting in a saving of more than £5 million for the taxpayer.

Forming part of the A244, the bridge will provide motorists, pedestrians and cyclists with access to major employers, schools and retail centres. The scheme also includes junction improvements, a widened pathway along the riverside and improved facilities for horse riders.

The bridge will replace the existing temporary crossing which is coming to the end of its working life.

Norman Baker said:

>The Government is committed to delivering major transport improvements which help aid economic growth and I am delighted to be able to announce funding approval for this important scheme.

>Following the outcome of the spending review we challenged all scheme promoters to look again at the cost of proposed schemes to ensure we get maximum value for money for every pound we spend. Surrey has stepped up to the mark by achieving a saving to the taxpayer of more than £5 million on the original proposed cost of the bridge.

>The new bridge will bring long-term benefits for all those travelling in the area. Without this investment motorists would have faced huge disruption and delays as the temporary bridge reached the end of its life. In addition the scheme will improve road safety at each end of the bridge as well as increasing headroom for boats, opening up access to the river and providing wider foot and cycle paths.

Surrey County Council expects to commence construction works in early 2011 and for the new replacement bridge to be completed and opened to traffic by summer 2013, with the existing temporary bridge being removed and final landscaping works completed in spring 2014. 

The new crossing will be built immediately upstream from the existing bridges towards Weybridge, which will make it possible to keep the current road bridge open to traffic throughout the construction period.

The improvement scheme will also improve headroom for boats and open up access to the river.

## Notes to Editors

  * Walton Bridge provides an important link across the River Thames between Shepperton and Walton-on-Thames, forming part of the A244. Approximately 34,000 vehicles use the existing bridge on weekdays. 
  * Today's funding announcement will provide funding for Surrey County Council to replace the two existing temporary bridges that are currently in use. The existing viaduct over the Cowey Sale floodplain will be incorporated into the scheme as a bridleway link to the new riverside path.
  * This announcement gives final funding approval for the scheme and the Department for Transport has agreed to provide a total capped funding contribution of £23.8755 million towards the total project cost of £32.372 million. Surrey County Council, as scheme promoter, will provide the remaining costs towards the scheme. 
  * Full approval allows the council to commence construction which is expected to start in January 2011.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101026,Transport Secretary gives go-ahead to new schemes and over £600m more funding,Major upgrades which will relieve congestion at a variety of places across the country.,"Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, gave a major boost to the UK economy today by announcing the go-ahead for a further 16 road and public transport schemes.

Along with the eight schemes announced by the Chancellor last week, work will therefore begin on a total of 24 schemes as a result of the Department for Transport's spending review settlement.

The schemes given the green light today, subject to statutory processes, will deliver major upgrades to relieve congestion at the following locations either through widening or managed motorways schemes:

M60 Junctions 8 - 12  
M1 Junctions 32 - 35a   
M60 Junctions 12 - 15  
M1 Junctions 39 - 42   
M62 Junctions 18 - 20  
M25 Junctions 5 - 6/7   
M25 Junctions 23 - 27   
M6 Junctions 5 - 8   
A556 Knutsford - Bowdon

The following key local infrastructure projects were also confirmed, subject to a best and final offer from local authorities: 

* A new single carriageway bypass which will ease congestion in Sefton and improve access to the region's motorway network; 
* An integrated package of sustainable transport improvements in Ipswich including improved bus facilities and walking and cycling routes;
* Improvements to M5 J29, east of Exeter, providing access to new housing and employment areas;
* A bypass to the north of Lancaster, connecting the port of Heysham to the M6;
* Improvements on the A57 east of M1 J31, near Todwick; 
* A new road in Taunton to provide additional cross-town capacity and access to areas of brownfield land; and
* A new bus station and associated transport improvements in Mansfield.

In addition, the Transport Secretary ann and councils will be challenged to consider the cost, scope and possibility of local funding when bidding.

The Government believes this competitive process will ensure that the greatest possible number of schemes, with the best value for money, will be able to proceed, facilitating economic growth and providing jobs across the country. 

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:  
>Whilst we have had to make some tough choices, I am pleased that spending on transport was treated as a priority for the Government in the Spending Review. 

>This Government sees transport as a key driver of growth nationally and in the regions. So I am delighted to be able to give the green light to 24 new transport projects and a fund worth over £600m for many more schemes to bid for.

>Taken together, this investment will not only bring benefits in terms of reduced congestion, shorter journey times and more efficient public transport, but also provide a vital economic boost. For every pound we spend on Highways Agency schemes, on average we will get back £6 of benefits and in many cases there are even higher returns for local authority schemes.

>Transport is vital to securing the UK's long term prosperity. That is why these schemes are so important and why I will continue to argue for investment which delivers long term benefits for both the travelling public and the economy as a whole.

The Government also announced that the Highways Agency will continue work on developing a further 14 schemes in preparation for them to start in future spending review periods, as funding becomes available, and will review the design of a further four with the aim of finding a best value solution. 

##  Notes to editors

* Subject to these offers from local authorities being acceptable, funding will be confirmed in January 2011. 
3. A pot of over £600 million will be available to fund further local authority projects. The department will conduct some further analysis on the following schemes - the 'development group' - and invite best and final funding bids from this pot:
* Waverley Link Road (Rotherham)  
* Beverley Integrated Transport Plan

* A38(M) Tame Viaduct Maintenance (Birmingham)  
* London Road Bridge Maintenance (Derby)  
* Leeds Inner Ring Road Maintenance
5. The level of funding required for schemes already under construction is such that it is unlikely that any new schemes will be able to begin construction before 2012-13.
6. The department will consider the following three schemes with conditional approval for full approval and will set out specific requirements with each promoter bilaterally: 
* Walton Bridge (Surrey)   
* Reading Station Highway Works   
* Isles of Scilly Link 
* The department will look carefully at the costs and scope of each scheme and explore possibilities to reduce costs and increase local contributions. We hope to agree a way forward on funding by January 2011 but this will be dependent on progress on these issues.
7. The department cannot at this point consider any new local authority schemes other than those in the above groups.
8. Additionally, the Highways Agency has in development 18 major road schemes. Given the current assumptions, it will not be possible for these schemes to enter construction until at least 2015. We will continue work on 14 of these schemes with the aim of starting construction after 2015: 
* M1/M6 Junction 19 Improvement  
* M25 Junction 30  
* M6 Junctions 10a - 13  
* A14 Kettering Bypass  
* A160/A180 Immingham

* A38 Derby Junctions  
* A45/A46 Tollbar End  
* A453 Widening  
* A5-M1 Link Road  
* A63 Castle Street

A further four schemes will be reviewed, to ensure the design is the best possible, and to see if there are better ways to sequence the work:

* M20 Junction 10a  
* M3 Junctions 2 - 4a  
* M4 Junctions 3 - 12  
* M54 to M6/M6 Toll link road.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101004b,Transport Secretary suspends M4 bus lane to benefit all road users ,M4 bus lane suspended from 8 November 2010,"Motorists and hauliers are to benefit from an extra lane on a key stretch of the M4 near London, Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, announced today.

This will be achieved by suspending the M4 bus lane and opening it to all motorists travelling towards the capital - not just licensed black taxis, motorcycles and buses.

The Transport Secretary ordered the suspension after latest analysis showed that journey times at peak periods would be reduced for car drivers and hauliers without significantly affecting vehicles currently allowed to use the lane. 

The suspension will begin before Christmas and remain in place until June 2012 when the lane becomes part of the Olympic Route Network for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. After this the intention is to remove it permanently.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said: 

>I want to keep traffic moving and improve journey time reliability through making the most of our existing roads.

>The M4 is a vital strategic route and therefore it is important that we do everything possible to reduce congestion on it.

>Once the Olympics are over my intention is to scrap the bus lane permanently as I believe excluding road users in this way is unfair and damaging to the economy.

The Highways Agency will monitor the suspension over the next 18 months and traffic data gathered will be used to inform the Government's final decision about the future of the bus lane.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The M4 bus lane runs eastbound towards London for 3.5 miles between junctions 3 and 2 of the three lane section of motorway. 
  * An experimental order under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 will come into force on 8 November 2010. From this date work will take place to suspend the bus lane, including the removal of signs and road markings and introduction of a revised road layout. 
  * The lane is expected to be fully open to all road users from 24 December 2010 until June 2012 when the Olympic Delivery Authority plans to put in place traffic management measures on this section of the Olympic Route Network to facilitate onward travel by athletes arriving at Heathrow.
  * If evidence supports the permanent removal of the bus lane, then a revocation order will be made following the appropriate processes, including consultation.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100930,Public inquiry ordered on Humber Bridge tolls application ,The Humber Bridge Board wants to increase the tolls on the bridge from 1 April 2011.,"A public inquiry on proposals to increase the Humber Bridge tolls has been ordered by the Government.

The Department for Transport has received an application from the Humber Bridge Board to increase the tolls on the bridge effective from 1 April 2011.

Given the likelihood of objections to the proposals the Government has decided to order a public inquiry immediately.

Regional and Local Transport Minister, Norman Baker MP, said:

>We know that there is a great deal of interest in the tolls on the Humber Bridge, and that a variety of individuals, businesses and local groups are likely to have views on the Bridge Board's proposals. 

>It is only right that any parties with an interest are able to put forward their objections at a public inquiry. That is why we have decided to proceed directly to the public inquiry stage where the case for and against any increase can be heard in full.

A public notice will be published by the Humber Bridge board providing details of the public inquiry, the proposed increase and where objections can be sent.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The Humber Bridge is governed by the Humber Bridge Act 1971.
  * Sections 10(3) of the Humber Bridge Act 1971 provides that the Secretary of State shall cause a local inquiry to be held if required by the applicant or by any person with a substantial interest who has objected to the application and has not withdrawn his objection.  In addition, the Secretary of State ""may in any case, if he thinks fit, cause a local inquiry to be held"". In this case the Secretary of State has decided to exercise these discretionary powers and proceed directly to a public inquiry.
  * The tolls on the Humber Bridge were last raised in 2006.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/df-press-20100929,M1 motorway improvements announced,"Additional capacity, improved journey time reliability, and increased safety at two junctions of the M1 given the go-ahead","A scheme to provide additional capacity, improve journey time reliability, and increase safety at two junctions on the M1 was today given the go-ahead by Transport Minister Mike Penning. 

Junction 11 (Dunstable) and 12 (Toddington) will be upgraded to maximise the benefits of the Managed Motorways system - including hard shoulder running - currently under construction on a 15-mile stretch of the motorway between Junction 10 (Luton) and 13 (Milton Keynes).

Confirmation of the go-ahead for the junction improvements comes following a public inquiry.  The Minister today confirmed the scheme orders had been approved in line with the recommendations of the inquiry and that construction will begin next year.

Transport Minister, Mike Penning, said:

>I am pleased to be able to give the go-ahead to these important junction improvements today. They will help maximise the benefits of Managed Motorways on a nationally-important route linking London and the South East with the Midlands and the North.

>As well as improving traffic flow on the motorway, slip roads and junctions, the scheme will also provide improved facilities for cyclists and pedestrians, including a combined footway and cycleway over the A5120 at junction 12.

Today's decision will allow the Highways Agency to deliver the full package of improvements by 2013.  When the scheme is** **complete, the Highways Agency will open up the hard shoulder as a running lane and use variable speed limits to improve traffic flow during busy periods on the M1 junctions 10 to 13.  This will reduce congestion and improve safety on this key artery for both the national and local economies.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The scheme is made up of two work packages:  
- Mainline Works - delivery of Hard Shoulder Running (HSR) within the existing highway boundary between Junctions 10 to 13  
- Junction Works - improvements to Junctions 11 and 12 which are required to resolve capacity issues at the junctions and to prevent traffic queuing back onto the mainline, thereby disrupting the operation of hard shoulder running
  * The mainline works were not subject to full statutory procedures because they are being delivered within the highway boundary.  The junction improvements, however, require land-take and are subject to full statutory procedures, including draft orders and a public local inquiry. 
  * In the summer, Ministers agreed that public inquiries planned for road schemes should be postponed until the completion of the spending review.  However, the public inquiry into M1 J10 - 13 junctions was allowed to go ahead given that the improvements are an integral part of a scheme already under construction.
  * A local public inquiry was held for the at the Superdrug Stores Plc Distribution Centre, Prologis Park, Dunstable, on seven sitting days between 8 -17 June 2010, before Mr M P Hill, BSc, MSc, CEng, MICE, FGS, an independent Inspector appointed by the Secretaries of State for Transport and for Planning.  
  * Download today's decision, together with the Inspector's report
  * The junction improvements are planned to start in February 2011.  Construction of the M1 Junctions 10 to 13 Hard Shoulder Running scheme commenced in December 2009. Both schemes will be completed in 2013. 
  * Junction 12 will be improved by providing a new signalised half-cloverleaf junction located approximately 40 metres to the north of the existing A5120 over-bridge at Junction 12, with new slip roads connecting the motorway to the A5120.  Junction 11 will be fully signalled with additional lanes on slips roads and additional lanes on the A505 Dunstable Road approaches. 
  * Funding for the full scheme, including the junction improvements, was approved by Treasury in December 2009.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110916,A1 north of Newcastle to be route of strategic national importance  ,Sixty-five miles of the A1 north of Newcastle join a list of key national roads.,"Proposals to identify the A1 north of Newcastle to the Scottish border a route of strategic national importance were published today by Transport Minister, Mike Penning.

The move would see approximately sixty-five miles of the A1 join a list of key roads that Ministers consider for funding from the national budget for road improvements.

The proposal is part of the Government's move to ensure the economic importance of routes from England to the capital cities of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are properly recognised.

A number of roads linking Bootle with Twelve Quays Ferry Terminal in Birkenhead, Merseyside, would also become a route of strategic national importance under the proposals. This is because it is the main passenger and freight ferry terminal for traffic travelling between Liverpool and Belfast.

Transport Minister, Mike Penning, said:

>Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff make a significant contribution to the UK economy and it is vital that the routes connecting them to their nearest strategic destinations in England are recognised. The current system does not do this and it is time to rectify it. 

>While my proposals will promote connectivity between all capital cities of the UK, it is of particular significance for the A1. Campaigners have long fought to have the A1 north of Newcastle recognised as being of national, rather than regional, importance and I agree. 

>This change will not guarantee funding for major improvements, however, it will finally recognise the road's importance for freight and other strategic traffic travelling between Newcastle and Edinburgh.

Last year fourteen Strategic National Corridors (SNCs) were identified by the Department for Transport - recognising the economic importance of road and rail routes linking the largest English cities with the busiest ports and airports in England. 

However the current criteria do not specify that key road and rail routes providing links between Newcastle and Edinburgh, Liverpool and Belfast or Bristol and Cardiff should be included.

In practice Cardiff is linked to Bristol via the M4 and M48, which are already recognised as routes of strategic national importance. But Edinburgh and Belfast are currently unconnected to SNCs by road.

##  Notes to editors 

  * A [Written Ministerial Statement](http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/penning-20100916) announcing the consultation was published today
  * The [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/sncconsultation) will close on Friday 10th December. 
  * The consultation identifies two additional routes of national strategic significance: 

- The A1 north of Newcastle - between its junction with the A19 at Seaton Burn - to the Scottish border (providing a defined link to Edinburgh);   
- Approximately nine miles of Local Authority controlled roads between Bootle and Twelve Quays Ferry Terminal in Birkenhead, including part of the A565 and the Kingsway Tunnel (providing connectivity with Belfast). 

  * The full route is as follows:  
- A565 from junction with A5036 in Bootle to A5063 ""Leeds Street"";   
- then A5063 ""Leeds Street"" from junction with A565 to A59 ""Scotland Road"";   
- then A59 ""Scotland Road"" to ""Kingsway Tunnel"";   
- then ""Kingsway Tunnel"" to grade separated junction with A5027;   
- then A5027 to junction with A5139;  
- then A5139 to A554;   
- then A554 to Twelve Quays Terminal entrance.
  * The A1 north of Newcastle is currently a Highways Agency (HA) regional road. If the proposal is agreed, it will become a HA national road. Prioritisation of funding for the future development of the road would be with the Secretary of State, rather than local stakeholders.
  * The route identified in Merseyside will not be added to the trunk road network. Responsibility for day-to-day operational decisions, maintenance and improvement will remain with the relevant local Highway Authorities. The Secretary of State will, however, maintain a watching interest in the route and its effectiveness in providing strategic connectivity.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100826,Councils urged to cut street clutter,"Getting rid of unnecessary signs, railings and advertising hoardings in our urban spaces.","Councils will today be urged to get rid of unnecessary signs, railings and advertising hoardings in a bid to make streets tidier and less confusing for motorists and pedestrians.

Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles, and Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, are concerned that the character of the country's urban spaces is being damaged and have written to councils leaders calling on them to reduce the number of signs and other 'street clutter'.

The Government believes that in some cases traffic signs and railings are installed by councils in the mistaken belief that they are legally required.  However, although some signs are required by law, Government advice is that for signs to be most effective they should be kept to a minimum.  To help councils do this the Department for Transport is reviewing traffic signs policy and new advice on how to reduce clutter will be published later this year. 

Ministers want communities to inform local authorities of particularly bad examples of clutter as part of the Big Society in action. Organisations who promote good urban design like Civic Voice, Living Streets and fixmystreet.com are already helping people alert councils to examples of clutter and showing people how to carry out street audits. 

Eric Pickles said:

>Our streets are losing their English character. We are being overrun by scruffy signs, bossy bollards, patchwork paving and railed off roads wasting taxpayers' money that could be better spent on fixing potholes or keeping council tax down. We need to 'cut the clutter'.

>Too many overly cautious townhall officials are citing safety regulations as the reason for cluttering up our streets with an obstacle course when the truth is very little is dictated by law. Common sense tells us uncluttered streets have a fresher, freer authentic feel, which are safer and easier to maintain.

>Organisations like Civic Voice, Living Streets and fixmystreet can help councils provide a Big Society solution - local people carrying out street audits will bring power and character back to neighbourhoods.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>""We all know that some signs are necessary to make our roads safe and help traffic flow freely.  But unnecessary street furniture is a waste of taxpayers' money and leaves our streets looking more like scrap yards than public spaces.

>We have written to councils to remind them that it need not be this way - we don't need all this clutter confusing motorists, obstructing pedestrians and hindering those with disabilities who are trying to navigate our streets.

>Empowered local communities working together with councils can bring an end to this blight on our national landscape.

Salisbury is a beautiful Cathedral City, full of history and renowned architecture. However the Salisbury Civic Society concluded, after carrying out a survey of over 60 streets, that it has become cluttered over time markedly reducing its character. They found the city centre was littered with hundreds of bollards. For example one parking area for 53 cars had 63 bollards. They now have a comprehensive public realm strategy aimed at creating an attractive, safe, clean and green city.

Tony Burton, Director of Civic Voice, said:

>Too many streets are plagued with pointless clutter, blighting the local environment and people's lives.  Civic Voice believes in streets we can all be proud of.  Our Street Pride campaign gives people the power to make a difference.  With today's welcome backing from the Government we should reclaim our streets and see them cleared of clutter.

In addition to reducing clutter, well designed streets can also help reduce accidents. Street clutter was removed from Kensington High Street, which has helped reduce accidents by up to 47 per cent. The revamp of Oxford Circus reduced street clutter and barriers and introduced a diagonal crossing to let pedestrians navigate one of London's busiest intersections faster. 

Tony Armstrong, Chief Executive of Living Streets, said:

>It's about time action was taken on our cluttered streets. For too long have pedestrians had to struggle with unnecessary bollards, guard-railing and pointless signs. Community involvement, stronger guidance from central government and a coordinated approach from local councils are all crucial ingredients to rid our streets of unnecessary obstacles for pedestrians. Councils in particular should ensure that de-cluttering is prioritised and championed across all departments. 

>Through our own audits with local communities and councils, we have found that stripping back street clutter transforms our streets from trip hazards to enjoyable open spaces where people want to walk. We welcome this step towards cutting the clutter.  

The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment's (CABE) technical design expertise has also helped councils and communities with practical advice on cutting clutter and creating the best public space.

  * Government advice is clear that ""the excessive or insensitive use of traffic signs and other street furniture has a negative impact on the success of the street as a place"" and that ""street signs are periodically audited with a view to identifying and removing unnecessary signs"" Manual for Streets, Department for Transport, 2007)
  * Traffic signs, road markings, street furniture, advertising boards and other obstacles all contribute to street clutter. Many signs and lines are simply not needed, perhaps a legacy of earlier but obsolete schemes or unnecessary duplicates provided as part of a 'belt and braces' approach to design. Wherever possible, these should be identified, reviewed and removed on a regular basis as a cost-effective means of improving the streetscape. (Traffic Management and Streetscape, DfT local transport note 1/08)
  * Appropriate warning signs can greatly assist road safety. To be most effective, however, they should be used sparingly.(Traffic Signs Manual)
  * The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) is available to support community groups and other bodies to ensure that buildings and public spaces are well-designed and managed. There is a range of case studies that communities and councils can draw on
  * Several organisations are also helping reduce street clutter including:  
- **Civic Voice**is the national charity for the civic movement.  It makes places more attractive, enjoyable and distinctive and promotes civic pride. Street Pride is Civic Voice's national campaign supporting local action to help rid our streets of unnecessary clutter.  At its heart is a street survey undertaken by local people to provide evidence for councils to take action.  The local surveys are being combined to support a national call for action to create more streets we can be proud of.  Civic Voice's[ street pride campaign toolkit and briefings ](http://www.civicvoice.org.uk/campaigns/street-pride/)can be downloaded here  
- **FixMyStreet** helps people report, view, or discuss local problems they've found, problems such as graffiti, fly tipping, broken paving slabs, or street lighting, to their local council by simply locating them on a map. It launched in early February 2007. The free site reports postings to the relevant council by email. The council can then resolve the problem the way they normally would. Alternatively, you can discuss the problem on the [website](http://www.fixmystreet.com/) with others, and then together lobby the council to fix it, or fix it directly yourselves.  
- [**Living Streets**](http://www.livingstreets.org.uk/news/uk/-/stripping-back-street-clutter) believes that streets should be designed with people in mind. Unnecessary street clutter and design can get in the way of people safely making their journey on foot.

Following contractual arrangements being finalised today this Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funding is expected to deliver:

-   Installation of nearly  28,000 new lighting columns within the first five years;
-   Replacement of nearly  6,000 illuminated traffic signs and bollards;
-   Reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions of 38%; and
-   The provision of state of the art technology which will enable Coventry City Council to have a flexible approach to street lighting and to be pro-active with early detection of defective lighting. 

Regional and Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>This is very good news for Coventry. Better lighting means a reduction in the fear of crime, less light pollution and a safer, more user-friendly night time environment for everyone. 

>This project, which is being delivered using Private Finance Initiative funding, will deliver real benefits to residents, motorists and pedestrians alike. Partnerships like this provide a framework for investment in much-needed improvements in our local public services and communities.

The council has signed individual PFI contracts with Balfour Beatty. It is expected work will commence later this year.

In 2008, following a public inquiry, the Department for Transport accepted an independent Inspector's recommendation that the main scheme orders should be made - and the scheme to dual 17 miles of the A46 has been under construction since summer 2009.

Today, suggested amendments to the published scheme - which were considered at a further public inquiry earlier this year - have been accepted by the Department for Transport and included into the scheme.

The amendments involve side roads and property accesses at nine separate locations. 

Mike Penning said:

>The A46 is an important regional strategic road connecting the East and West Midlands and this improvement scheme will reduce congestion, improve safety and provide a bypass for East Stoke and Farndon.  I am therefore pleased to announce that these outstanding matters can now be included into the improvement scheme that is under construction.

The scheme is expected to be completed and open to traffic in summer 2012.

The work will dual the last remaining single carriageway section between M1 Junction 21a north of Leicester and Newark Western relief road.

##  Notes to editors 

  * Today's decision is in response to the Secretaries' of State for Transport and Communities and Local Government's earlier decision of 18 December 2008 following consideration of the Inspector's report of the local inquiry held in 2007, where the Secretaries of State accepted the need to reconsider design aspects of some of the earlier proposals in respect of side roads and means of access to property.  These supplementary Orders result from the reconsideration of those aspects of the scheme at nine separate locations. 
  * A local public inquiry into the supplementary Orders was held on eight sitting days between 12 January and 14 April 2010, at the Cotgrave Welfare Centre, Cotgrave in Nottinghamshire, before Mr W S C Wadrup, BEng(Hons), CEng, MICE, FCIHT, an independent Inspector appointed by the Secretaries of State for Transport and for Planning.

The scheme - the third in the country - will give Northamptonshire County Council more powers to coordinate road works and take tough action when they overrun.  It will allow the council to require anyone carrying out road works to apply for a permit in advance and to set conditions on timing, coordination or the amount of road space to be left available to road users during the works.  Those companies who break the terms of their permit or work without a permit will have to pay a fine.

Norman Baker said:

>I am delighted to be able to give the go-ahead for Northamptonshire's permit scheme. 

>Although we all know that road works are sometimes unavoidable the disruption they cause can be a hugely frustrating for drivers, cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians as well as costing businesses time and money.  That is why it is important that councils use the powers they have to make sure utility firms carry out works with consideration for those who use the road. 

>We are determined to tackle problem road works and make sure that those who dig up the road are made accountable when disruption occurs.

Northamptonshire is the third council to gain approval for a permit scheme.  Kent County Council and London councils had their schemes approved last year.  These councils will be monitoring all the schemes to make sure that they are producing benefits for local residents and feeding this information back to the Department for Transport.

## Notes to Editors

  * Northamptonshire County Council is the first English local authority in the Midlands to have its application for a street works permit scheme approved by the Government as meeting the requirements of the Traffic Management Act 2004 and The Traffic Management Permit Scheme (England) Regulations 2007.  Northamptonshire County Council has been asked to nominate its preferred date for its permit scheme to come into effect.  DfT officials will work with the Council to give effect to the scheme on that date, by means of a Statutory Instrument. 
  * A council running a permit scheme is able to charge companies for providing a permit although any charge should cover costs and should not result in a surplus.  It will be a criminal offence to work without a permit. The maximum fine will be £5,000. It will be an offence to not meet a permit condition, for which the maximum fine is £2,500. Fixed Penalty Notices, as an alternative enforcement mechanism, can also be given for working without a permit or not meeting a permit condition. Councils in England have been able to apply to the Department for Transport to run their own street works permit schemes since the relevant Regulations came into force in April 2008. 
  * Northamptonshire County Council is responsible for the details of its scheme, and the timetable for its introduction. 
  * Permit schemes are already in place in Kent and London.

There is currently no problem with fuel supplies. But if a strike were to go ahead, supplies of fuel to some, but not all, forecourts across the UK could be affected.

The Government is able to take a number of steps to minimise disruption, in particular to make sure the emergency services get the supplies they need.

Motorists can help by following the following sensible advice at this point, before there is a strike and when there is no problem with supply:

  * There is no need to queue at petrol forecourts.
  * There is no urgency to top up your tank.
  * Check travel sites and latest news before travelling.
  * Stick to speed limits as this helps conserve fuel.

Highway authorities, mapping providers and satnav manufacturers are gathering at the Department for Transport after agreeing to the Minister's call to work more closely to ensure everything possible is done to make sure the right vehicles are on the right roads.

The summit is being chaired by the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transportation (ADEPT) - which represents councils in transport - and ITS(UK) which promotes intelligent transport technology and whose membership includes satnav companies.

At present, it can take months for map updates to make their way from local councils to satnavs. As a result, drivers follow out-of-date maps and local residents end up with inappropriate traffic on their doorsteps. The summit will look at ways that satnavs can better reflect local conditions and whether they can unlock local authority information on parking availability or roadworks.

Local Transport Minister, Norman Baker, said:

>Out of date directions mean misdirected traffic - a scourge of local communities. I am pleased that highway authorities, mapping companies and satnav manufacturers have agreed to work more closely to provide drivers with accurate, up-to-date information on traffic restrictions such as narrow roads or low bridges.

>The summit will see a plan of action agreed to ensure motorists are given the best possible directions and help prevent huge lorries from being sent down narrow country lanes and through small villages.

>This is timely because from next month we are allowing local authorities to reclassify roads - ensuring A roads are placed where they want traffic to run and lowering the category of road in places they want traffic to avoid - rather than having to come to Whitehall for approval. These powers will help councils make sure that drivers are using suitable routes.

Ministers are also tackling the misery caused by lorry drivers following satnavs down narrow and inappropriate roads as part of a package of new traffic signs rules.

Under the new rules councils will no longer need Whitehall approval to introduce certain new signs or some existing ones that they need to use on a regular basis - including one to warn lorry drivers of unsuitable roads.

### Further information

The [new policy on road classification is available](/publications/road-network-policy).

ADEPT - the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transportation - was formerly known as the County Surveyors Society, and represents councils in transport, planning, waste and other related areas.

ITS(UK) - Intelligent Transport Systems (UK) - is the UK association for the promotion of intelligent transport technology, including satnav devices. It has over 160 members, both in the satnav industry and the public sector.

The Government hopes that the review will dramatically reduce the number of signs councils need to use by relaxing rules - such as by removing the requirement for some signs - including those to indicate the start of a pedestrian zone, to be placed on both sides of the road.

The new measures will significantly cut red tape by allowing councils to put in place frequently used signs without needing to get government permission every time. There are also proposals to save councils money by allowing them to publicise their Traffic Regulation Orders in a manner that is appropriate for the target audience, rather than forcing them to pay for newspaper advertising as is currently the case.

In addition, there will be changes to reflect the way that travel has transformed over the decades, to make sure that road users are getting the right information at the right time.  There will be new signs to alert drivers to parking spaces with charging points for electric vehicles and councils will be able to indicate estimated journey times on cycle routes, to help people plan their journeys.

Norman Baker said:

>This is the most far-reaching review of traffic signs in 40 years. We are cutting pointless bureaucracy, giving councils more freedoms, and updating our suite of signs for the modern era.

>Sometimes the jungles of signs and tangles of white, red and yellow lines can leave people more confused than informed.  This expensive clutter can also leave our roadsides looking unsightly and unwelcoming, so the changes I am announcing today will help councils cut the number of signs they need to use.

>We will also be allowing councils to use different ways to get information to drivers, encouraging them to question whether some signs are needed at all and publishing new advice for councils to help them reduce clutter on their roads.

>We want to make sure that there is consistency across the country while allowing local authorities greater discretion in how they use signs on their roads rather than demanding they get approval from Whitehall for signs they need to use regularly.

>These changes will ultimately save councils money and lead to more attractive streets which improve the quality of life for local people.

The new framework  includes measures to update and improve traffic signs to make sure that they reflect the way we travel now, as well as providing clear information on prohibitions on the road network. Changes will include: 

  * Measures to improve cycle journeys by allowing journey times as well as distances to be added to signs on cycle routes and making it easier for councils to use Trixi mirrors to improve visibility of cyclists at junctions and 'no entry except cycles' signs to allow contra-flow cycling;
  * A new sign warning lorry drivers that a road is unsuitable for their vehicles.  This will help to prevent situations where lorries following sat nav systems use inappropriate roads, sometimes causing disruption to the local road network and delays to their journey; 
  * Measures to simplify some parking signs after research showed that, although overall understanding of traffic and parking signs among drivers is good, there is scope for some signs to be made clearer;
  * Allowing councils to use innovative new measures such as pedestrian countdown timers and diagonal crossings without Government approval.

Measures to reduce the impact that traffic signs have on the environment and help cut costs for councils and central government by reducing the levels of bureaucracy needed to put signs in place include:

  * Issuing guidance to councils to encourage them to improve their streetscapes by identifying and removing unnecessary traffic signs;
  * Reducing bureaucracy and costs for councils wanting to use 20 mph schemes by cutting the number of signs they need to put in place and making it easier to use variable 20 mph speed limits where necessary, such as outside schools;
  * Reducing the lighting requirements for signs, so as to reduce costs and carbon emissions; 
  * Allowing publicity for new traffic regulation orders, e.g. for parking restrictions, to be more targeted at those who are affected by proposed changes, helping councils to reduce costs;
  * Reducing the need for councils to gain approval from the Department for Transport to put in place certain commonly used signs such as those which indicate that parking places are reserved for car club users.  This will result in a reduction in signs requiring DfT authorisation of around 40%.

The Traffic Signs Policy Review started in September 2008.  The full review document, 'Signing the Way', can be found here:  [www.dft.gov.uk/publications/signing-the-way](http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/signing-the-way).

## Notes to Editors: 

The Department for Transport's wide ranging Traffic Signs Review started in September 2008. This has been the most fundamental review of the approach to traffic signing for 40 years and the key aim has been to develop a traffic sign system that will both meet the changing needs of road users and provide effective tools for the better management of the road network, incorporating new technologies and minimising the impact on the environment. 

Research commissioned alongside the review has also been published today and can be found here:

While as an employer you are best placed to maintain safeguarding practice on the ground, from September 2012, the Government is scaling back the criminal records and barring systems to 'common sense' levels whilst ensuring that they continue to provide effective safeguarding. These changes will impact on organisations across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and it is important for employers to understand what the impact of these changes might be in their organisation.

The most important changes will be to reduce the numbers of people requiring criminal record checks by reducing Regulated Activity and scrapping Controlled Activity. This means that criminal records checks will only be mandatory for those working in close and unsupervised contact with vulnerable groups including children.

The projects have won funding totalling £113 million as part of the second allocation from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. They are led by 29 English local authorities with many more as partners and cover eight regions. All projects are designed to create a sustainable transport package that delivers economic growth and reduces carbon emissions.

The successful schemes include a variety of measures including improving sustainable transport options for commuters, creating public transport hubs, building better cycling infrastructure and even providing a new ferry service.

Norman Baker said:

>The schemes we are funding today will benefit communities from Devon to Durham by cutting carbon emissions, reducing congestion and stimulating economic growth in these areas.

>By investing in these projects we are signalling our commitment to green growth which will help to kick-start economic activity in local areas while improving access to healthier forms of transport and addressing the problem of climate change.

The schemes to be funded include:

  * **Smarter Travel Slough** which will reduce congestion on main roads in the rush hour by increasing the use of walking, cycling and public transport. This will improve air quality and health while supporting business efficiency.
  * **Walk to School Outreach** will see Durham County Council working with national charity Living Streets and eight other councils to increase the number of children walking to school in 854 primary and 182 secondary schools nationally. The project aims to reduce congestion and improve health through exercise.
  * **Travel Torbay Regeneration Project** will deliver a new fast ferry service between Torbay and Brixham which will see journey times cut by half, a new cycle route to encourage more low carbon journeys and a supporting package of employer based travel planning to help increase use of public transport.
  * **Access to Jobs, Training and Services in Stafford** will aim to reduce congestion at peak times in Stafford by improving access to walking, cycling and public transport. People will be encouraged to reconsider their travel habits through offers of discounted bus travel and a new mobile cycle centre providing cyclists with information and advice as well as selling reconditioned bikes.
  * **Sustainable Transport Access to Tourism on the Isle of Wight** will improve the island's sustainable transport network to support its bid to become a leading destination for green tourism. This will include the provision of transport hubs and easily-accessible live travel information to help visitors and local people plan their journeys. Walking and cycling routes will also receive a boost.

A full list of the successful bids can be found below. All the schemes for which funding has been confirmed today are also receiving contributions from the local council or the private sector. In total, the £113 million provided by DfT is allowing more than double that amount to be invested in these important projects.

These local schemes will bring national benefits. In addition to supporting economic growth enabling and encouraging people to make more sustainable travel choices, the projects will reduce delays on the roads in urban areas, delays which cost the economy around £11 billion a year. They will also help tackle problems such as poor air quality and improved cycling and walking infrastructure will help to improve the health of the nation.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120424a,Truck trials to drive down carbon from freight,Trials of carbon-cutting trucks are set for support from Government.,"Trials of carbon-cutting trucks are set for support from Government, Transport Minister Mike Penning has announced.

Industry trials will benefit from £9.5m invested by the Department for Transport and the Technology Strategy Board.

Truck operators are now being invited to bid for a slice of this funding as part of a competition which opens today, April 24.

The '[Low carbon truck demonstration trial](https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/low-carbon-truck-demonstrator-trial)' will deliver fleets of low-emission heavy goods vehicles as well as supporting infrastructure such as fuelling stations and electric recharging hubs.

Mike Penning said:

> ""This competition will help drive down emissions from trucks.

> ""Almost a quarter of carbon from transport in this country comes from heavy goods vehicles, so this is a key area for us to tackle.

> ""These trials will show us how low-carbon technologies perform day-to-day in the real world, providing vital data to build operator confidence in these green trucks and allowing us to make policy choices based on hard evidence.

> ""The investment in gas refuelling infrastructure will also give haulage firms a push to buy gas-powered HGVs - leaving a legacy that will support low-carbon transport well into the future.""

Companies wishing to take advantage of the funding have until June 20 to bid for up to £750,000 each.

Trials will run for two years and data collected over this period will be used to inform Government policy on low-carbon road freight.

To qualify for the competition, vehicles must deliver carbon savings of at least 15% compared with the equivalent conventional vehicle. A variety of technologies are eligible for funding under the rules of the competition including gas-powered, dual fuel or hybrid trucks of over 7.5 tonnes and electric vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.

Gas refuelling infrastructure funded by the competition will be made accessible to other commercial and public-service vehicle operators, helping to build a network around the country.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20120117,Plug-in car grant extended to vans,News release about how van buyers will be able to receive 20% - up to £8000 - off the cost of a plug-in van.,"Van buyers will be able to receive 20% - up to £8000 - off the cost of a plug-in van, Transport Minister Norman Baker and Business Minister Mark Prisk announced today.

This is an extension of the Plug-In Car Grant which offers 25% - up to £5000 - to motorists buying a new plug-in car. Ministers have also re-confirmed there is funding secured for this grant until 2015.

The purpose of the consumer grant is to enable the purchase of ultra-low carbon vehicles which could otherwise have been unaffordable. The consumer will also benefit from lower running costs over the lifetime of the vehicle.

Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>Electric vehicles are the arrowhead for a low carbon revolution in motoring and as more models come to market we'll begin to see sales gather pace.

>Car buyers have had a year to take advantage of our grant and now it's time for van buyers to get their chance to go electric. This is great news for businesses given the lower running costs of these vehicles - fleet buyers tell us that this is one of the most important factor influencing their decision on what to buy.

>It is radical initiatives like these which will allow us to create a transport system that both cuts carbon and is an engine for economic growth.

Business Minister Mark Prisk said:

>Supporting ultra-low carbon technology in vans makes sense. An upfront purchase grant, when combined with lower running costs and tax benefits, can make switching to an ultra-low carbon van an attractive choice for businesses.

>The technology also fits well with a large portion of the van market that rely on short urban trips to and from base.

From today ultra-low carbon van manufacturers will be able to apply to be part of the Plug-In Van Grant - which will help to improve local air quality in cities, reduce carbon emissions and meet Government carbon reduction targets.

To [be eligible for the scheme](/topics/sustainable/olev/plug-in-van-grant/), vans will have to meet performance criteria to ensure safety, range, and ultra-low tailpipe emissions. Consumers, both business and private will receive the discount at the point of purchase.

There are currently 10 cars eligible for the Plug-In Car Grant - 5 of which came onto the market in 2011, with the other half expected to be available to purchase this year. During the first year of the scheme, over 1000 eligible vehicles were registered and, up to 31 December 2011, 892 applications were made for the Plug-In Car Grant.

### Notes to Editors

  1. [Further details about the Plug-in car and van grants](/topics/sustainable/olev/plug-in-car-grant/), including the manufacturer application process and the criteria vans must meet to be part of the grant.
  2. Only vans which meet strict performance criteria for range, tail-pipe emissions and safety will be eligible for the Plug-In Van Grant. The application process opens today and van manufacturers are invited to apply for their vehicles to become part of the scheme. Applications can be received at any time. The Department expects to confirm shortly the first vans to join the scheme, for which applications will need to be received by 31 January.
  3. As announced at the Spending Review, the Government has made provision of over £400m to promote the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicle technologies. This includes approximately £80m supporting research and development activities; £30m for the installation of infrastructure; and, £300m to support consumer incentives for the life of the Parliament.
  4. The Government committed to monitor the scheme to ensure it remains the most effective way of delivering consumer incentives ensuring value for money for the tax payer - the need for and value of the grant, as well as its scope was examined. In reviewing the Plug-In Car Grant the Government's strategy to support the transition from the early ultra-low emission vehicle market to mass market was also revisited.
  5. Fleet running costs were [identified as the most important factor influencing fleet management decisions by fleet purchasers by researchers for 'Industry review ](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/pnc-2010-q4-fleeteye-review.pdf) - Quarter Four 2010', Fleeteye/The University of Buckingham.
  6. A National Chargepoint Register is being established to make it easier for drivers to locate recharging points and to track the growth in the national charging network. This will be operational early this year.
  7. The Government's assessment is that the number of installed chargepoints in the UK is more than 2500, of which 765 have been delivered (to 14 October 2011) through the Government's Plugged-In Places trials and the remainder through private sector organisations' investment. The private sector organisations have commitments to deliver approximately a further 4000 points across the UK by the end of 2012.
  8. During 2011, 1052 vehicles eligible for the Plug-In Car Grant were registered in the UK and 892 applications were made for the Plug-in Car Grant (Quarter 1; 465; Quarter 2 215; Quarter 3 106; Quarter 4 106). Manufacturers apply for the grant following the purchase of the car hence the lag between registrations and grant applications.

The National Chargepoint Registry, to be developed by POD Point - a UK-based chargepoint manufacturer - will be a publicly-accessible database of chargepoints across the UK. Alongside this, a new system - the Central Whitelist - will be created to make it easier for motorists to access each chargepoint without having to sign up to new schemes each time they charge in a different location.

Norman Baker said:

>We know there is public appetite out there for plug-in vehicles and as government we're doing everything possible to make them a real option for both motorists and industry.

>This Registry will get us away from the mind-set of; will I, won't I get there? And I'm sure that public and private chargepoint owners alike will get behind the initiative because the more information we have up there the more motorists will be encouraged to make the switch to electric.

>The Central Whitelist offers charging scheme operators a really straightforward way to share membership card details - it will enable their members to access chargepoints outside their 'home' charging scheme. This freedom to roam between charging schemes is a very important step forward for the plug-in vehicle market.

>There is no doubt that low-carbon vehicles are here to stay, we will continue to work with industry to create a world-leading charging network that really reflects the needs of its users.

Mark Prisk said:

>The National Chargepoint Registry delivers our commitment to make it easier for motorists considering ultra low carbon cars to access charge points and so encourage their take-up.

>This is a real opportunity for companies to use the data in innovative ways while meeting consumer demand for information which will help them get to their destinations.

The Registry will allow businesses to innovate and provide products, such as satnav and mobile apps, for plug-in vehicle owners to access. Motorists will then know where and how they can charge along their journey, so addressing concerns about the range of vehicles and the new 'Central Whitelist' will increase people's charging options - enabling members of a particular charging scheme (e.g. the Source East) to easily access chargepoints in other areas of the country (e.g. the Midlands).

Flora Heathcote, Commercial Director POD Point said;

>Whilst we are perhaps best known as a charge point manufacturer, half our business is actually software development. We were the first company to introduce networked charge points to the UK, and currently run several of the charge point networks across the UK.

>We are delighted to be selected by OLEV to create the central charge point network, and believe this cements our position as the leading developer of charge point management systems in Europe.

## Notes to editors

  1. The development of a National Chargepoint Registry and Central Whitelist was a commitment made in the [Government's Infrastructure Strategy](/publications/plug-in-vehicle-infrastructure-strategy) published earlier this year.
  2. [POD Point](http://www.pod-point.com) has been awarded a contract worth £89k (excluding VAT). They will be hosting the data on a server, and are creating systems that will allow plug-in vehicle recharging schemes to easily upload and download information. They will also place data from the National Chargepoint Registry on data.gov.uk and will create a system that allows real time interrogation of this data by mobile devices such as mobile phones and in car navigation systems.
  3. Schemes interested in adding their information to the systems should get in touch with POD Point: [flora.heathcote@pod-point.com](mailto:flora.heathcote@pod-point.com).
  4. The Central Whitelist will be a registry of membership card information for different recharging membership schemes (e.g. for regional schemes such as the Plugged-In Places). The registry will make it easier for card holders to access chargepoints across the country, and potentially internationally, without having to sign up to new schemes each time they charge in a different location (provided the schemes in question have developed the necessary commercial arrangements).
  5. Neither of the systems will store data of a personal nature (such as names, addresses or bank details).
  6. Both systems are due to go live early next year. The project will develop and deploy the National Chargepoint Registry and Central Whitelist for a period of approximately 24 months after which it is expected that responsibility for the system will transfer over to the Plug-in Vehicle infrastructure industry.
  7. The Government has a £30m fund to kick-start installation of recharging points in 8 areas across the country. The Plugged-In Places projects are installing infrastructure in London, Milton Keynes, North East England, the Midlands, Greater Manchester, the East of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
  8. The Government has made provision of over £400m to promote the uptake of ultra-low carbon vehicle technologies. This includes approximately £80m supporting research and development activities; £30m for the installation of infrastructure; and, subject to review, provision of around £300m to support consumer incentives for the life of the Parliament.
  9. The Plug-in Car Grant is a consumer grant of up to £5,000, or 25% of the value of the car, which consumers can benefit from directly at the point of purchase.
  10. The Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) is a cross-Whitehall team that has been established to manage this programme of measures.

The Government's vision for recharging infrastructure, to support the electric vehicles revolution, has been announced today by Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31.

Today's publication Making the Connection: the Plug-In Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy identifies how recharging infrastructure will develop in a way that is targeted, convenient and safe.

It sets out the steps that Government, as part of its £400m programme to support ultra-low emission vehicles, and industry will take to support an infrastructure that encourages the majority of recharging at home, at night, and after the peak in electricity demand, supported by workplace charging for commuters and fleets, and a targeted amount of public infrastructure.

The Transport Secretary also announced that the Renault Fluence has become the tenth vehicle now eligible for the Plug-in Car Grant - a generous consumer grant of up to £5,000. 

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said;

>The ability to re-charge is a key part of the jigsaw in supporting the growth of the electric vehicle market.  It is crucial therefore that we make the process as simple as possible.

>Public chargepoints are part of the answer but putting a chargepoint on every corner is not the right approach. It is most convenient for drivers and best for the energy system for the majority of charging to happen at home.

>Electric cars mean getting out of the mentality of needing to travel to a petrol station and into the habit of refuelling when a vehicle is not being used.

>This Strategy will help maintain the UK as a global leader in the design, production and use of electric and ultra-low emission cars and at the forefront of efforts to decarbonise motoring.

The strategy outlines support for plug-in vehicle infrastructure through;

  * Ensuring plug-in vehicles are an attractive choice for the motorist** **- e.g. ensuring that Britain's smart metering is implemented so that cars can charge when it's cheapest for the consumer; providing comprehensive information through a National Chargepoint Registry so when a motorist needs to use a public chargepoint they know where to find one; ensuring systems are in place so that all chargepoints can be used by all motorists; and challenging industry to resolve, by the end of the year a range of technical issues that will allow the market to grow in the UK.
  * Making it easier for private enterprise to provide recharging infrastructure by removing regulatory barriers - e.g. establishing a Permitted Development Right for chargepoints so they no longer need planning permission; and Ofgem will consult this year on an exemption that makes it clear that charge point owners and operators can sell electricity via chargepoints at the market rate;
  * Proposing the inclusion of policy on plug-in vehicle infrastructure in the National Planning Policy Framework, due for consultation next month, to encourage local authorities to consider adopting policies to include plug-in vehicle recharging infrastructure in new domestic, workplace and retail developments.

Business Minister Mark Prisk said:

>The UK wants to be a World-leader in ultra low carbon technology and today's strategy is the next step in our achievement of that aim.

>I hope today's report will accelerate the growth of the ultra low carbon vehicle market by giving clarity about the Government's plans.

This strategy builds on the existing favourable tax regime for private and business purchasers of ultra-low emission vehicles, and over £400m worth of investment to promote this agenda, including up to £5,000 consumer grants for plug-in cars; and £30m to kick-start installation of recharging points in test-bed areas.

The money is part of the Government's drive to target investment in new projects that promote green growth and encourage use of sustainable local transport.

All English regions will benefit with funds which have been paid to 20 bus operators and 6 local authorities. All the buses are expected to be in service by 2012.

Norman Baker said:

>My vision is for a transport system that cuts carbon and creates growth.

>Low carbon buses emit around 30 per cent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than standard diesel buses and use around a third less fuel - that is why it was so important to kick-start the market.

>They also represent an important and developing industry - both in this country and throughout the world - which has the potential to create jobs and boost economic growth.

>Green buses are therefore an absolute no brainer - they are the perfect combination of targeted investment that help people make the transport choices that are good for society as a whole.

Green, low carbon hybrid-electric buses supported by the Fund are already in operation in London, Manchester, Oxford and Reading. Electric buses supported by the Fund are operating in Durham.

## Notes to editors

  * The Government's Green Bus Fund is a scheme through which bus operators and local authorities bid for grant to help them purchase new low carbon buses.
  * A low carbon emission bus (LCEB) is a bus that is able to achieve the LCEB target for greenhouse gas emissions, which is equivalent to a 30 per cent reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions compared to a current Euro 3 diesel bus of the same total passenger capacity. These buses will all meet the latest air quality standards, delivering at least Euro V EU emission standards.
  * Bus operators and local authorities were able to bid for funding towards the cost of a low carbon bus. This grant was to help them to meet the additional upfront cost of the vehicles.
  * The Fund has been a great success story. We have paid out more than £46 million in grant to 20 bus operators and six local authorities which will part-fund 542 new low carbon emission buses to operate in England by March 2012. The majority (97 per cent) are hybrid-electric vehicles with the remainder all-electric buses.
  * Green Bus Fund buses will be operating in all regions in England by March 2012.
  * 143 buses supported by the Fund are now in operation in Greater Manchester (51 buses), London (50 buses), Oxford (27 buses), Reading (six buses), Leeds (six buses) and Durham (three buses).
  * Alexander Dennis Limited will benefit most from the Fund, having received 53 per cent of the funded bus orders. Optare received 27 per cent of the orders and Volvo/Wright Bus received the remaining 20 per cent.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110404,£5m to tackle transport emissions in London ,New money to help improve London's air quality.,"Transport Secretary parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 has committed an additional £5m funding to the Mayor of London Boris Johnson to help improve air quality in the capital.

This exceptional funding is for a programme of localised measures designed to improve London's air quality and help compliance with legally binding European targets.

The Mayor intends to use the money to establish a Clean Air Fund to extend measures in place at the small number of locations in central London that are at risk of exceeding the daily limit value for particulate matter (PM10), including Marylebone Road. These include: trials of dust suppressant technology, redeployment of the cleanest buses on routes through these areas and measures to reduce vehicle idling. 

Other measures being developed that could now be extended include travel plans for local businesses, traffic smoothing measures, the development of a no-idling zone, local cycling and walking schemes and the introduction of greening - for instance, tree and vegetation planting - to help absorb particles.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>Reducing pollution from transport is a top priority for the Government and that is why, despite the current severe fiscal restraints, I have been able to provide £5m from in-year savings in the Department's budget for this important initiative.

>Not only will this money help improve the environment for Londoners but it will also mean that we avoid costly infraction proceedings from the EU which could have cost us tens or hundreds of millions.

>I look forward to seeing in detail the Mayor's specific plans and working together with both GLA and TFL to continue to improve air quality in the capital.

The European Commission recently granted the UK more time to comply with legal standards to control particle pollution in London subject to the formal submission to the Commission of more detailed plans on the city's pollution measures. 

Boris Johnson said: 

>Pollution is a serious health issue for London so we welcome this cash to help us expand our existing work to tackle it.

>We will use this money to create a fund for a package of clean up measures at the places where it is most needed, such as Marylebone Road, to the benefit of people living and working in these areas.

>This fund will join our panoply of initiatives to cut pollution such as a cleaner New Bus for London, a city-wide electric driving scheme and record investment into cycling.

###  Notes to editors 

  * The EU's Ambient Air Quality Directive 2008 requires Member States to ensure that levels of various pollutants in ambient air comply with certain standards. Air quality across much of the UK is excellent, but parts of London do not yet comply with the standard for particulate matter (PM10).
  * On 11 March 2011, the European Commission awarded a temporary and conditional exemption in the Greater London Urban Area for the air quality standards for PM10. Further details are set out in the [ Commission's press release](http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/285&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en) of 11 March 2011.
  * This allowed the UK some additional time to comply with the air quality standard for PM10 on the condition that a number of short term measures were introduced to control activities which contribute to the risk of the PM10 limit value being exceeded. If these measures are not introduced, the risk of the Commission progressing infraction proceedings against the UK is likely to increase.
  * This is a new requirement that was not foreseen at the time of the TfL funding agreement during last year's Spending Review. London is the only UK location assessed to have areas that do not comply with the PM10 limit value. This money is being made exceptionally available due to savings within the past financial year (2010/11) within the Department for Transport.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110330,Government proposes longer lorries to help cut carbon ,Consultation proposes allowing increase in length of articulated lorries to try to cut carbon amounts.,"Some lorries could be allowed to use longer trailers after independent research showed that this could cut carbon without compromising safety. The research is being published today by Roads Minister, Mike Penning, alongside a consultation seeking views on the proposed changes. 

Today's consultation proposes allowing a two metre increase in the total length of articulated lorries operating within the existing weight limit of 44 tonnes. This would take the maximum permitted length of an articulated lorry to 18.75 metres but would not allow any increase in overall weight. The Department for Transport estimates that this move could increase capacity for hauliers transporting lightweight goods by up to 13 per cent and cut carbon emissions by around 100,000 tonnes each year. 

Mike Penning said:

>The road haulage industry is vital to the economy, making goods and services accessible across the country.

>These proposals would allow haulage firms to use one larger truck where previously they may have needed to send two vehicles. This will help to make our haulage industry cleaner and greener as well as allowing businesses greater flexibility without compromising safety.

>I hope that everyone with an interest in this issue will take time to look at this consultation and let us know their views on this proposed change.

The proposed changes would make the total permitted length for articulated lorries 18.75 metres; the maximum length for lorries using a truck and drawbar trailer is 18.75 metres. The Government has ruled out any further increase in length.

As there is no proposed increase in weight there is not expected to be any additional pressure on road surfaces caused by the proposed increase in length.

Details of the [consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/open/2011-06/) and [study ](http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/freight/research/longersemitrailer/)

##  Notes to editors 

  * In 2006, DfT commissioned research into the potential effects of longer, heavier vehicles (LHVs) including longer semi-trailers - [Longer and/or Longer and Heavier Goods Vehicles (LHVs)](http://www.trl.co.uk/online_store/reports_publications/trl_reports/cat_vehicle_engineering/report_Longer_and/or_Longer_and_Heavier_Goods_Vehicles_LHVs___a_Study_of_the_Effects_if_Permitted_in_the_UK_Final_Report.htm).The research eas completed in 2008 and highlighted a number of drawbacks that make the introduction of significantly longer and heavier vehicles (ie typically 25.25 metres long) - those beyond the existing limits of 18.75 metres length and 44 tonnes gross vehicle weight (GVW) - impractical on either a permanent or a trial basis in the UK. Consequently, the Government has ruled out the introduction of this type of LHV for the foreseeable future.
  * The report also indicated that there could be benefits from permitting a small increase in the length of current articulated vehicles while remaining within both the overall permitted weight and the dimensions already permitted for rigid truck / drawbar trailer goods vehicles. 
  * In June 2009, DfT therefore commissioned a further study into the feasibility and impacts of allowing longer semi-trailers to operate within the British road haulage market, within the existing weight limit of 44 tonnes GVW. The primary objective was to establish whether the introduction of longer semi-trailers would deliver overall economic, environmental and societal benefits or disbenefits.
  * Current UK regulations limit the maximum loading length of semi-trailers to 13.6 metres. The study has considered two main possibilities: increasing this by up to one metre to 14.6m in total, or increasing it by up to 2.05 metres. The latter option would increase the maximum permitted loading length of a semi-trailer to 15.65 metres, which would provide the same loading length as an existing rigid truck / drawbar trailer combination. This represents the greatest increase that could be permitted under EU rules without having to accept the longer, 25.25 metre combination vehicles into the UK.
  * The study has concluded that while an increase of one metre could produce some benefits, there are potentially very significant advantages in allowing 15.65 metre semi-trailers. At this length the semi-trailer would have to be equipped with a steering system to meet existing manoeuvrability requirements. The study has also concluded that overall, the benefits from maintaining existing construction standards are greater than those that would be gained from tighter standards, which would effectively rule out conventional rear steer technology.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20110119,Funding boost for local authorities as Government sets out transport strategy,Funding boost for local sustainable transport projects to help create economic growth and reduce carbon emissions.,"Local authorities are set to receive an unprecedented £560m funding boost for sustainable transport projects to help create economic growth and reduce carbon emissions.

Full details of the Local Sustainable Transport Fund are published today in a Government white paper [Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon](/publications/making-sustainable-local-transport-happen/) which aims to encourage greater use of public transport and more walking and cycling. 

Among the aims of the strategy which sets out a vision for local solutions which will have a national impact are:

  * Cutting red tape for councils while cutting carbon; 
  * Getting quick wins locally by investing in smaller scale schemes to help create jobs
  * Giving local people more power over initiating innovative transport schemes in their own areas to better meet local needs e.g. supporting schemes like 'Wheels to Work' in North Yorkshire and Devon which gives people in rural communities access to personal transport to get to work or training.

Regional and Local Transport Minister, Norman Baker, said:

>A good transport system is vital in our efforts to deliver two key government priorities: to help grow the economy and to reduce carbon emissions. Investment in local sustainable transport can deliver quick gains with both objectives, which is why, even in these difficult financial times, we are providing an unprecedented £560m to take this agenda forward.

>We are clear you can have your green cake and eat it. Money invested wisely in local transport initiatives can both help the economy and cut carbon. It's a win-win for local people and for the country as a whole.

>I look forward to working with local authorities and others as we take on this challenge and believe together we can make genuinely sustainable transport a reality for everyone.

Key measures in the White Paper include:

  * A £560m Local Sustainable Transport Fund to address the urgent challenges of building economic growth and tackling climate change, as well as delivering cleaner environments, improved safety and increased levels of physical activity;
  * A commitment to work with the transport industry to support the development of e-purses and other technology related to smart ticketing; and to deliver, with operators and public sector bodies, the infrastructure to enable most local public transport journeys to be undertaken using smart ticketing by December 2014;
  * Further incentivising integrated ticketing and joining up the dots to deliver easier end-to-end journeys using public transport;
  * A reduction in the bureaucratic burdens on local authorities by:  
- simplifying access to transport funding;   
- allowing councils to decide on road classifications without going; through central Government; and   
- simplifying the regulations for introducing new road signs;  
- highlighting the importance of the national standard for Cycle Training and specific funding for Bikeability and the 2011/12 Cycle Journey Planner to encourage cycling.

The Government also announced today that £11m from the Fund will be spent on Bikeability - cycling proficiency for the 21st century - helping 275,000 10-11 year olds benefit from 'on road' cycle training. This funding will support a specific objective of the white paper to increase the number of people who use cycling as a mode of transport.

The Local Sustainable Transport Fund is now one of just four grant streams for local transport funding. This is part of the radical simplification and reform of local transport funding to support the localism agenda, reducing the number of funding streams from nearly 30 to just four.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101214,Electric car revolution revs up ,Grants for trailblazing cars - part of the electric and ultra-low emission car revolution in the UK.,"The Government drove the UK firmly into the fast lane of the electric and ultra-low emission car revolution today as Ministers unveiled nine trailblazing models that will be eligible for generous grants of up to £5,000.

Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, and Business Minister, Mark Prisk, announced the milestone which could make 2011 the year of the electric car for the UK - and revealed five more regions that will be installing local charging points having successfully bid for a share of a £20 million fund.

From January, the motoring map of the country will start to be redrawn as government and car industry work in partnership to give drivers a wide choice of clean, green transport. 

The first nine cars to become eligible for eco-friendly car grants are: 

  * Mitsubishi iMiEV;
  * smart fortwo electric drive;
  * Peugeot iON;
  * Citroen CZero; 
  * Nissan Leaf; 
  * Tata Vista EV; 
  * Toyota Prius Plug-in; 
  * Vauxhall Ampera 
  * Chevrolet Volt. 

More will follow next year.

The grant will be available to motorists across the UK from 1 January 2011, reducing the cost of eligible cars by a quarter, up to a maximum of £5,000.

The Government is also encouraging a new network of electric vehicle recharging points in streets, car parks and commercial retail and leisure facilities as driving electric cars becomes a part of everyday life for pioneering British drivers. The successful bidding consortia in this second phase are based in: the Midlands; Greater Manchester; East of England; Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, said: 

>A few years ago, ultra-low emission cars with mass market appeal appeared just a pipe dream. Now they are a reality and we can have all the convenience of the car without all the carbon that normally goes with it. 

>Government action to support affordable vehicles and more local charging points means we are on the threshold of an exciting green revolution - 2011 could be remembered as the year the electric car took off.

>The British public has in the past shown it's ready to embrace new technology and take practical steps to adopt a lifestyle kinder to the environment, so we could really be at the start of something big.

Business Minister, Mark Prisk, said: 

>Today's news that motorists will be able to choose from at least nine cars under the consumer incentive scheme and that we are expanding the infrastructure for charging electric vehicles will further reinforce the message that the UK is Europe's leading producer of ultra low carbon vehicles.

Today's announcement further confirms the UK as a global front runner in the market for ultra-low emission cars and open for business for hi-tech green manufacturing. This builds on Nissan's decision to produce the Leaf in Sunderland and the work the Automotive Council is doing to improve the way Government works with industry.

The winners of the second round of the Green Bus Fund - which aims to encourage and help bus operators and local authorities to buy new hybrid and electric buses - will now be able to purchase around 170 vehicles which will operate in most of our main cities and some rural areas by March 2012.

The funding will help towards the additional up front cost of buying low carbon buses and provides the capital investment required to bring down costs for operators. 

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said:

>Low carbon buses use at least 30 per cent less fuel and emit nearly a third less carbon than a conventional bus, yet they currently make up just 0.2 per cent of buses on the road. 

>This sector therefore has tremendous potential to reduce the impact of road transport on climate change.

>The Green Bus Fund is vital to unlocking this potential and will also stimulate a growing market.

The first round of the competition saw 24 bidders share £30 million, which is helping to support the purchase of around 350 new low carbon buses. Buses supported by the scheme are now in operation in Oxford, Manchester and Durham.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100916,Electric dreams move closer to reality ,£24 million to develop the UK's low carbon vehicle capability for mass market electric cars.,"Mass market electric cars moved a step closer today as Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, awarded £24 million to further develop the UK's low carbon vehicle capability.

The six winning projects - which together with contributions from business will receive total funding of £52m - are part of the latest Technology Strategy Board competition. Projects include the development of new engines for plug-in hybrid versions of Nissan, Lotus and Jaguar Land Rover cars, a lightweight electric bin wagon, development of lightweight materials for vehicle weight reduction, and new technologies using thermal energy to improve vehicle performance. 

The Government also set out the eligibility criteria for its Plug-in Car Grant. Under the scheme motorists will receive a grant of up to £5,000 to purchase electric, plug-in hybrid or hydrogen fuelled cars. In order to be eligible, cars must meet appropriate safety standards and must have been crash tested.  They must also meet minimum range and performance criteria.

The Government believes that this combined support will place the UK at the forefront of low carbon automotive development and provide a vital economic boost for the UK economy by giving us a key competitive advantage in this increasingly important global market.

Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31, said:

>I am determined to make this Government the greenest ever and transport will have a key role to play.  But this will not be achieved by forcing people off the road - it's not the car that's the problem, it's the carbon.

>While I am convinced that rail will be the future of long distance inter-urban journeys, we can't ignore the fact that 84% of journeys are made by car and there is no realistic prospect of displacing the private car for point to point complex journeys.

>However, we are on the brink of a technological revolution that will transform the way we see motoring in the 21st century allowing the benefits that the private car delivers without destroying the planet in the process.

In line with the Coalition Agreement commitment to mandate a national recharging network, guidance has also been released to the 15 places interested in bidding for the second round of the Plugged-In-Places infrastructure programme. This sets out in more detail what we want from these projects to support our decision-making on a national recharging network. 

Business Minister, Mark Prisk, said: 

>The winning consortia are all exciting examples of the breadth and depth of the UK's technical capabilities in low carbon vehicles. 

>Collaboration between UK-based vehicle manufacturers, supply chain companies and academia will help Britain become one of the leading centres for the design, development and manufacture of ultra-low carbon vehicles. 

>All of these projects had to demonstrate a credible route to market. This is about real business opportunities and high-tech jobs being created from the move to a low carbon economy.

Hybrid Integrated Urban Commercial Vehicle  
Consortium members: Dennis Eagle Ltd (lead company), MIRA Ltd, Magnomatics Ltd, MTL Group Ltd  
Project Description: The Hybrid Integrated Urban Commercial Vehicle (HIUCV) is a lightweight Heavy Goods Vehicle designed for refuse collection in an urban environment.  Fuel efficient, highly manoeuvrable and quiet, the HiUCV is targeted to halve the overall carbon emissions per tonne of waste collected of current best-in-class Refuse Collection Vehicles (RCVs) in the urban environment.  This will be achieved through exploiting innovative British technologies in the supply chain partners. 

The HIUCV will be designed to significantly exceed legislative and Government requirements for greener vehicles.  This project will produce a demonstrator for a commercially viable, highly competitive, improved performance RCV for urban use with a high percentage of UK sourced technology and components.

CREO - CO2 Reduction through Emissions Optimisation
Consortium members: Ford Motor Company Ltd (lead company), Jaguar Land Rover, Johnson Matthey Plc, ITM Power (Trading) Ltd, Revolve Technologies Ltd, Cambustion Ltd, University of Bradford, University of Liverpool, University of Birmingham.  
Project Description: For vehicles to have minimal impact on air quality, catalytic converters have been fitted to modern engines.  Although great strides have been made to improve the fuel economy of vehicles there is still an impact of about 4 per cent due to the emissions control system.  This project aims to re-design the engine and after-treatment as a complete system, meeting legislative, customer and business requirements while minimising CO2 levels.  This will be achieved through the use of novel after-treatment techniques, the on-board generation and use of hydrogen and the development and application of new optimisation tools. 

The major contributors to this project are Ford Motor Company, which manufactures about 2 million engines per year in the UK, Jaguar Land Rover, which installs engines supplied by Ford, and Johnson Matthey, which provides many of the catalytic converters fitted into these engines.  The potential UK supply chain is enhanced with the inclusion of ITM who will provide specialist equipment during the project.  Three vehicles will be built to demonstrate the potential of the technology - petrol and diesel cars and a diesel hybrid bus.  The target is a 4 per cent improvement in CO2 by 2015 potentially rising to 15 per cent by 2025.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100705-2,£15m Government funding for green buses,"Over 150 low carbon buses will join fleets throughout England saving around 50,000 tonnes of CO2.","Over 150 new low carbon buses will join fleets throughout England saving around 50,000 tonnes of CO2, thanks to £15 million of additional Government funding, Transport Minister, Norman Baker, announced today.

The funding is intended to put low carbon buses within the reach of as many operators and local authorities as possible throughout England.

Bus operators and councils can bid for the money which they can then use towards the additional up front cost of buying low carbon buses. 

Transport Minister, Norman Baker, said: 

>We want to support new transport technologies to help make our transport system greener and more sustainable. 

>This investment will stimulate the market for low carbon buses by reducing some of the initial costs for operators and councils. It will deliver significant benefits, in particular reducing the impact of road transport on climate change and improving air quality.

Low carbon buses use at least 30 per cent less fuel and emit nearly a third less carbon than a conventional bus, yet they currently make up just 0.2 per cent of buses on the road. 

The funding will support investment in more low carbon buses as well as addressing the information gap about their performance by requiring the winning bidders to share information with others in the industry.

Business Minister, Mark Prisk, said:

>This investment will help us deliver our commitment to build a low-carbon economy which will boost economic growth as well as help meet our ambitious climate change targets. 

>By placing ourselves at the forefront of the green technology revolution we will encourage future manufacturing success, generate new jobs and over the long run create new export opportunities.

##  Notes to editors 

  * The first round of the Green Bus Fund competition was run in 2009 with the winning 24 bidders announced in December 2009. The 24 winners are sharing £30 million which is supporting the purchase of around 350 new low carbon buses. This second round will see an additional £15 million being awarded in 2010.
  * A Low Carbon Emission Bus (LCEB) is a bus that is able to achieve the LCEB target for Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which is equivalent to a 30% reduction in its Greenhouse Gas Emissions compared to a current Euro 3 diesel bus of the same total passenger capacity. These buses will all meet the latest air quality standards, delivering at least Euro V EU emission standards.
  * Bus operators and local authorities will be able to bid for funding towards 90% of the difference between the cost of a LCEB and the cost of its standard diesel equivalent. The Department will assess the bids against published criteria and will award grant to the winners. This grant will help to meet the upfront cost of the vehicles.
  * The fund is also available for very low and zero emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles, and the Department would be interested in receiving bids which covered the demonstrations of such buses in regular use for services.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20100701,Low carbon car clubs given £40K boost,Government boost for car club development in the UK.,"Car clubs are set to benefit from an extra £40,000 of Government funding, Transport Minister, Norman Baker, announced today.

The money will be used to support car club development in the UK.

Membership of car clubs allows access to low carbon vehicles for short periods of time, often by the hour, on a pay-as-you-go basis. The clubs have increased massively in popularity with the number of members increasing from just 22,000 in 2007 to more than 127,114 members to date.

The Government views such schemes as an effective way of tackling congestion, reducing the level of CO2 emissions and improving the quality of life of citizens and communities. 

Members tend to choose to travel fewer miles by car compared to private car owners and the vehicles they do drive are more efficient.

Transport Minister, Norman Baker, said:

>""The Coalition Government, in its programme for government, has been clear in its commitment to sustainable travel initiatives such as car clubs to help achieve a greener and more sustainable transport sector. 

>The figures speak for themselves - each car club vehicle can result in taking 24 private vehicles off the road and the low carbon vehicles used typically emit approx 33% less CO2 than the average car. This is why we are supporting the continued growth of car clubs across the country.

Research has shown that pay-as-you-go car clubs reduce car use and support other sustainable travel initiatives by plugging gaps in journeys and promoting a shift in long term behaviour. 

Antonia Roberts, Director of Carplus - the national charity supporting car club development, commented:

>£40,000 may seem like a relatively small amount of funding but it has a huge significance in this period of reduced spending. The DfT's announcement signifies valuable support for car clubs, which can save individuals, businesses and local authorities money, reduce emissions and support sustainable transport objectives.

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 

>Car clubs are a brilliant idea and membership is booming in the capital. A quite staggering three quarters of the UK's car club cars are located in our great city, and Londoners joining up have found they are able to save thousands of pounds by avoiding all the hassle of repairs, services and insuring their vehicles. Our focus now is to increase membership in the capital's outer boroughs and I welcome all extra support for these cracking clubs, which are becoming indispensable to their thousands of members.

Today's announcement will combine with Transport for London's continued funding to support the provision of core services developing car clubs.

Ian Moffat, a car club member from London, said: 

>I am delighted with my car club membership. It's a much cheaper and greener alternative to running a car and, with its own dedicated parking space, I get to eliminate one of the biggest hassles of owning a car.

##  Notes to editors 

  * [Carplus](http://www.carplus.org.uk/) is the national transport charity promoting a rethink in car use by promoting the role of car clubs within a sustainable transport future. 
  * The announcement made by the Department for Transport of £40,000 is for Carplus to continue its core services, which include accreditation, data collection and information services for the promotion and development of car clubs.
  * The Transport Minister made this announcement in Richmond Upon Thames this morning.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dsa-press-20120710a,Driving tests brought closer to home with partnership deal,Driving tests could soon be available from branches of Halfords under plans announced today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.,"Driving tests could soon be available from branches of Halfords under plans announced today by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning.

As well as using traditional driving test centres, the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) is looking at working with public and private sector partners to provide driving test premises in selected areas that don't already have a local test centre. 

The DSA began exploring a new approach to test delivery last year, offering tests from premises such as local authority buildings and leisure centres. In March this year the Agency announced plans to extend the scheme to 21 more locations, and invited proposals from businesses and other organisations.

The DSA has now selected Halfords plc as a preferred partner, and is also exploring partnerships with the Fire and Rescue Service and several universities. In one location the Agency also expects to sign an agreement with training company Mantra Learning Ltd.

Partners will allow the use of their premises at no cost to DSA, and tests will continue to be conducted by DSA examiners. 

Road Safety Minister, Mike Penning, said:

>It is vital that public services are as open and accessible as possible. This initiative is a great example of how working with partners in the public and private sectors can help to ensure that we offer people the best possible service wherever they live.

>Our aim is to provide all driving test candidates with a local service that is convenient as well as being cost effective.

David Wild, Halfords CEO, said:

>We want to help motorists wherever we can, so we look forward to working in partnership with the DSA to provide a first class service for drivers taking their tests.

The scheme focuses on 21 locations, centred around five different areas across the country (Glasgow, Kettering, Manchester, Watford and Worcestershire). Testing from partner premises in these locations is expected to start from the autumn.

These arrangements apply to practical car tests; other types of test and theory test centres will not be affected.",7/10/2012,,,Driving Standards Agency,parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31,
http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101206,New Permanent Secretary for Department for Transport,Lin Homer to be the new Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport.,"The Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service Sir Gus O'Donnell is pleased to announce the appointment of Lin Homer as the new Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport.

Lin, who is currently Chief Executive at the UK Border Agency, was chosen following an open competition. This follows Robert Devereux's move to become Permanent Secretary at the Department for Work and Pensions. The appointment has been approved by the Prime Minister and by the Transport Secretary, parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31.

Lin will take up post in January. 

Sir Gus O'Donnell, said:

>I am delighted that Lin has been appointed as the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport. She brings a wealth of leadership experience in some of the country's most important public service delivery bodies - most recently at the UK Border Agency, and previously as Chief Executive of Britain's largest local authority in Birmingham where her responsibilities included highways, public transport and airports.

>I would like to thank Robert Devereux for his successful leadership of the Department, including through the recent Spending Review, and congratulate him on his appointment to be Permanent Secretary at the Department for Work and Pensions.

Commenting on her new role, Lin Homer said:

>I am very excited to be taking on this role at such an important time for transport and joining the many excellent professionals in Government and wider who help design and run our transport system. The Department has to contribute to the country's economic growth and also help to promote quality of life and the green agenda. As the last few days have shown, it has got to be able to focus on keeping the country moving at times of severe weather, whilst planning the transport system for the next few decades. I hope to be able to add my experience to that agenda.

parliamentary-under-secretary-of-state--31 said:

>I welcome Lin Homer to her new post and I look forward to working with her in addressing the challenges ahead. Robert Devereux has led the Department through the Spending Review and has started the restructuring process that Lin will now complete over the next few months. This will leave the Department well positioned to support economic growth and carbon reduction in a world of reduced public expenditure.

##  Notes to editors 

Lin Homer: Lin's previous position was as Chief Executive of the UK Border Agency, a post she held since 2005. The Agency has a staff of around 23,000 and a budget of some £2 billion per annum.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20101020,Transport spending review 2010,Information from the Transport Spending Review 2010,"The Government is committed to reducing the deficit, facilitating long-term, sustainable growth and tackling carbon emissions. In the Budget, the Chancellor pledged to make the tough choices that will allow us to maintain investment in new and existing infrastructure that will support a growing economy, while eliminating the structural deficit over the lifetime of the Parliament. 

Transport provides the crucial links that allow people and businesses to prosper. Our Spending Review settlement is based on cutting waste and taking hard decisions about priorities that have allowed us to secure the investment in vital transport infrastructure that will support the national economic recovery.

|**£ billion**| 2010-11 | 2011-12 | 2012-13 | 2013-14 | 2014-15 |
| Resource DEL1 | 5.1 | 5.3 | 5.0 | 5.0 | 4.4 |
| Capital DEL | 7.7 | 7.7 | 8.1 | 7.5 | 7.5 |
| **Total DEL** | **12.8** | **13.0** | **13.1** | **12.5** | **12.0**|

In this table, Resource DEL excludes depreciation

The for Transport will reduce overall spending by 15 per cent in real terms, making savings of 21per cent from our resource budget and an 11per cent reduction in capital spending.

**1. Tough choices**  
Efficiency  
We have taken big steps forward in improving efficiency -these savings will be delivered through better procurement and management of contracts, improved delivery of front line services, savings in rail costs and reduction of lower priority programmes. We are also reducing the administration cost of the central department by a third.

Refocusing lower priority programmes  
Our settlement will deliver savings by reducing expenditure on lower priority activities including some of our marketing and research programmes. This will ensure that scarce resources for government funded research are directed to those projects which most directly benefit the frontline and that only the most effective marketing approaches are continued. 

Revenue raising  
We have also taken the difficult decision to increase the cap on rail fares and increase the Dartford crossing charge. Raising rail fares means that we are able to secure investment in vital rail projects over the course of the Spending Review including investment in additional rolling-stock to reduce overcrowding and improve passenger comfort. The increase in the charges at Dartford will help fund proposals for a new, additional crossing. We will also introduce free-flow tolling in 2012, scrapping the pay booths, and in the meantime will lift the charges to allow free use of the crossing when there is severe congestion caused by hold-ups at the toll-plazas. 

**2. Secure investment**  
We have committed:

- £18 billion of rail investments, including Crossrail;  
- £4 billion on HA major projects, capital maintenance and enhancements;  
- £6 billion on local transport major projects, capital maintenance and enhancements;   
- Funding for a further tranche of PFI projects and  
- Funding to ensure the Tube upgrades will go ahead.

Passengers and motorists will benefit hugely from these investments, each of which support our economic growth. 

**3. Localism**  
The Coalition Government has made clear that it wants to end the era of top-down government by providing a radical devolution of power and greater financial autonomy to local authorities. Greater local control, participation and accountability is the most effective way to increase the sustainability of local transport systems so they can promote economic growth, minimise the environmental impact of travel, improve public health and address social exclusion. 

To deliver this, we are revolutionising the way local authorities receive transport funding. In the past, central Government dictated to local communities how and on what they should spend their transport funding. This will no longer be the case as local communities will now be free to decide what their own priorities are and will be able to set their budgets according to local, not national priorities. That is why we are moving from 26 grant streams to just four grant streams.

**4. Sustainability**  
By prioritising spending on sustainable rail projects such as high speed rail and Crossrail we will be providing commuters and intercity travellers with attractive new options instead of the car. However we recognise that for many people, particularly in rural areas, the car is the only practical choice and that is why we are prioritising spending on making the UK a world leader in ultra low carbon cars. By de-carbonising motoring, we can include the car in our vision of a future, low carbon, transport economy. Our Local Sustainable Transport Fund will enable local authorities to bid for money to address the transport priorities in making their communities safe and sustainable. 

We will be making further announcements on the details of the settlement and its impact on specific programmes in due course.

### **Annex A - Rail**

By making tough decisions on rail fares and by driving through efficiencies and industry reform, the Government will be able to go ahead with substantial rail improvements. Investment in rail will strengthen economic growth, tackle harmful carbon emissions, and improve quality of life.

Savings/additional funding for the railways will come from:

- **Rail fares: **The Government will increase the cap on regulated rail fares from the current RPI +1% to an average annual increase of RPI +3% for three years from January 2012. Because the Government recognises the impact of relatively high inflation at present, it has decided to retain the RPI+1% average cap for 2011. This means fares will increase in real terms by 10% over the next four years. This fare increase will mean the Government can deliver priority capacity improvements on the rail network to relieve overcrowding and improve passenger comfort. 

- **Efficiencies: **Through longer, better constructed rail franchises and competitive pressure we will work with train companies to improve efficiency, saving around £100m over four years. Network Rail have agreed to deliver extra savings of £185m - over and above the Office of Rail Regulation efficiency targets in the control period.

- **Industry reform: **The value for money study being led by Sir Roy McNulty has already begun to identify ways to make the railway more efficient and affordable. Some of these savings could be delivered quickly within the existing industry structure, others may require wider changes. However, we recognise our railways are too expensive for both taxpayers and farepayers, and we are determined to make the railway more affordable in the long term. We will announce our response to Sir Roy McNulty's initial findings and our plans for the future in due course.****

This approach will enable many major rail schemes to go ahead, including: 

- **Crossrail: **Crossrail will go ahead to the original scope. Working with Crossrail Ltd and the Mayor, Government has already identified substantial, engineering-led, savings to the Crossrail funding package, including through lengthening the delivery programme for the central tunnel works by around a year. Crossrail Ltd will also be doing further work to optimise the scheme's value for money, including reviewing the way in which services come into operation across the route to ensure that Crossrail services commence in a resilient and robust way. As a result, the funding envelope for the project will be reduced by around £1bn, while the scope of the project remains unaltered. We now expect the project to cost no more than £14.5bn.

- **High Speed Rail: **Subject to consultation, the Government will proceed with plans for a national high speed rail network, spending over £750m in the Spending Review period. When complete, this will dramatically reduce journey times and increase capacity on routes between Britain's major population centres. This would benefit the economy nationwide and provide a step change in Britain's transport infrastructure. Public consultation on the Government's overall strategy and on the proposed route from London to the West Midlands will start early in 2011.

- **Major station upgrades totalling £2.1 billion: **The Government will continue to fund Network Rail's programme to improve the passenger experience at Birmingham New Street, London Kings Cross, Reading redevelopment and Gatwick Airport stations. Birmingham New Street will be modernised through the Gateway Project which is expected to deliver economic benefits totalling £2bn. The Concourse area at Kings Cross will triple in size and provide better links to the Underground and international services. The track and platform enhancements at Reading and Gatwick Airport stations will improve journey times and ease overcrowding. 

- **Network improvements : **We will continue important network enhancement projects. Work on the Midland Main Line will deliver faster, more reliable journeys to Leicester, Derby, Nottingham and Sheffield. While faster more reliable passenger services to Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland will be made possible by a series of enhancements along the East Coast Main Line.

- **Rail freight: **The Government is committed to encouraging more freight from the nation's road network onto the railways and will continue to fund the ongoing projects to improve rail freight links between Southampton and the West Coast and between Felixstowe and Nuneaton. ****

The Government is currently considering revised proposals from Agility trains for the Intercity Express Programme. An announcement will be made in due course. Because aspects of Thameslink and HLOS rolling stock programmes, as well as projects to electrify the Great Western Mainline, and the rail routes around Manchester and Liverpool, are interdependent with the IEP decision, a full announcement on all these programmes will be made at the same time.

### **Annex B **- Highways Agency roads

**Major schemes**  
We have made tough choices about investment priorities for the strategic road network. As well as proceeding with existing commitments, the following new schemes are announced today (subject to statutory processes where necessary):

- The A11 in Norfolk - dualling the 'missing link' of single carriageway, between Fiveways junction and Thetford.   
- The M4 and M5 north of Bristol - fixing the worst congestion spot in the South West, and easing journeys to Wales.  
- The M1 in Derbyshire (junctions 28-31) - improving access to Sheffield using managed motorways technology.  
- The A23 in Sussex - dealing with a key bottleneck between London and Brighton  
- The M62 near Leeds (junctions 25-30) - adding capacity between Yorkshire and the North West using managed motorways.

The following schemes are not considered realistically likely to receive funding in the current SR period, or the next one, and therefore have been cancelled: 

| A21 Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst | A21 Flimwell to Robertsbridge |
| A19 Moor Farm | A1 Leeming to Barton | 
| A19 Seaton Burn Interchange | A47 Blofield to North Burlingham | 
| A21 Baldslow Interchange | |                                                                                                  The Highways Agency have been taking forward a number of other schemes whose priority we are still considering, in light of the SR settlement. Some will proceed in this SR period; others will be the subject of further preparation for possible funding in future SR periods. Further announcements will be made in the next few weeks.

These schemes represent sixty year investments. Alongside our policies to decarbonise road transport, our roads plan shows how we are planning for the long-term growth of our economy whilst ensuring we dramatically reduce the carbon impacts of motoring.

The roads programme includes one individual scheme which is estimated to cost over £1 billion to build - the A14 Ellington to Fen Ditton scheme. We recognise that this corridor faces severe congestion, and that mobility along the route is critical for economic success and growth. However, the current scheme is simply unaffordable under any reasonable future funding scenario. The Department is therefore withdrawing the current scheme. We will undertake a study to identify cost effective and practical proposals which bring benefits and relieve congestion - looking across modes to ensure we develop sustainable proposals. This approach will also provide an opportunity for the private sector to play its part in developing schemes to tackle existing problems in the corridor.

**Dartford  
**It is clear that additional capacity is needed at Dartford and that public funding to provide it is unlikely to be available. Therefore, DfT will embark upon a review of the options for future capacity increases at Dartford, funded by charges. In the mean time, we will increase charges for the Crossing. Subject to consultation, prices will increase from £1.50 to £2.00 in 2011 for cars, rising to £2.50 in 2012. Prices for other vehicles will also increase. Given its strategic importance the Department for Transport has decided not to sell the Crossing at the present time. 

At the same time, we will introduce free flow charging from 2012. And more immediately, we will lift the charges at times of severe congestion to aid flow through the charging plaza. 

**New governance**br />  
We are determined to get value for money across the Department and our main focus has been on more efficient working - doing more for less. To support this approach, we will appoint a non-executive chair for the Highways Agency, and will appoint a performance monitoring group to back up the Agency's efficiency drive. Looking to the future, we want to make sure that the Highways Agency is structured in the best way to deliver effective services. We will review the operation of the Agency to see whether broader reform can generate better value for money. 

**Maintaining the network  
**We will provide a network that continues to be maintained in a safe and serviceable condition, but at a lower cost. The average annual spend on maintenance in the four year Spending Review period to 2014/15 will now be £714m, compared to spending of £748m in 2010/11. We will achieve this by:

- New contracts and improved commercial management which will drive even better supplier performance and further value for money. 

- Making the most of our buying power by adopting a national framework for commodity purchase such as gantries and road surfacing which will deliver cost savings to suppliers and the Agency. 

- Investing in our asset management systems to better predict our maintenance needs.

- Reviewing technical standards to specify new assets at lower initial cost and extend the life of the assets we have. 

- Reviewing when and where maintenance takes place, looking closely at where less costly maintenance practices - such as day time works - should happen. 

- Review of renewal works leading to less frequent replacement of non-critical assets. 

**Incident management  
**We will deliver an effective and efficient Traffic Officer Service at lower cost that prioritises traffic management. This will allow us to respond to, and clear incidents in live traffic lanes more quickly. We will reduce the operating costs of the service by:

- Replacing our current National Traffic Control Centre PFI contract in 2011 with a smaller service-based contract, disseminating core traffic information for strategic traffic management at a lower cost. 

- Focussing regional control centres (RCCs) on incident response, and reducing the number of RCCs managing the network at night.

- Reducing the cost of on-road operations through flexible deployment of staff and vehicles to reflect traffic levels; introducing single crewing when appropriate; and reviewing our Traffic Officer Service vehicle strategy to make the fleet of vehicles cheaper to operate.

**Technology  
**We will continue to operate the network from our Regional Control Centres but will do so with a significantly lower level of capital funding. Our investment in motorway communications, cameras and electronic signage leaves us very well-placed to manage our busiest roads with a lower level of new expenditure. 

**Traffic information  
**We will continue to provide up to date on-road traffic information and disseminate this directly online and through other media. We will replace the National Traffic Control Centre next year with a new National Traffic Information Service that will offer an enhanced service at a lower cost, delivering savings of at least £13m a year.

### Annex C - Local

We will make 28 per cent savings from local transport revenue funding, in line with the wider revenue savings that the Department is making from its overall budget for transport. 

To support the localism agenda, DfT plans to carry out a radical simplification and reform of local transport funding, moving from 26 grant streams to 4 from 2011-12: 

I. a local sustainable transport fund (capital and revenue);  
II. major schemes (capital)  
III. block funding for highways maintenance (capital); and   
IV. block funding for small transport improvement schemes (capital).

All other specific grants are being ended, with the funding transferred and included in the main Local Government Formula Grant administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government. This excludes the few specific rail grants provided by the Department to local authoritiesThis approach will give local authorities greater flexibility in how they spend their funding, enabling solutions tailored for the specific needs and circumstances of individual communities. This is crucial if they are to deliver effective and efficient transport for their communities at a time of limited resources.

Details of block funding allocations to individual local authorities will be announced later this year around the time of the Local Government Finance Settlement.

### Local capital:

**Local Sustainable Transport Fund   
**We are establishing a £560 million local sustainable transport fund to challenge local authorities outside London to bid for funding to support packages of transport interventions that support economic growth and reduce carbon emissions in their communities as well as delivering cleaner environments and improved air quality, enhanced safety and reduced congestion. 

This replaces a range of previous grants for sustainable forms of travel. It represents a significant increase in funding for sustainable travel, which the Government believes can both support economic growth and reduce carbon emissions. 

Responding to calls from local government, the Fund will include a mix of £350m revenue and £210m capital funding over the next four years to maximise the toolkit of options available to local authorities

A small proportion of the fund will be allocated to provide continued funding for the successful Bikeability scheme, which offers high quality cycle training for young people. For the remainder of the funding, we will invite local authorities to develop packages of low cost, high value measures which best meet their local needs and effectively address local issues.

We plan to issue further details on this fund, including the application process and annual availability of funding, by the end of the year.

**Major projects**

We are providing over £1.5 billion for local authority major schemes over the SR period: over £600 million for committed schemes and over £900 million for new schemes. This level of investment is greater than the average annual spend on local authority major schemes over the last 10 years.

Whilst this is a considerable investment, not all previously proposed major schemes are affordable and tough decisions will remain necessary.

The following three schemes have been announced today:

- Mersey Gateway Bridge: a new large suspension bridge over the River Mersey between Widnes and Runcorn to ease congestion and unlock significant development opportunities;  
- Midland Metro: extension of tram line through Birmingham City Centre to a new terminus outside New Street station and replacement of the fleet of trams;  
- Leeds Station Southern Access: a new pedestrianised access from the rear of Leeds station to minimise journey times to/from the south of the city centre.  
- We will accelerate our agreed funding for the Tees Valley Bus Network so that the scheme can be delivered to a quicker timescale. We remain committed to completing the Tyne and Wear Metro upgrades.  
- Approvals are subject to project promoters reducing costs and/or increasing local contributions. Further announcements on the funding status of specific schemes will be made over the coming days.  
- We will also be looking to develop less bureaucratic successor arrangements to the previous Government's Regional Funding Allocations for transport that, over time, give a proper voice in scheme prioritisation to elected local authorities and business interests. We hope that Local Enterprise Partnerships will have an important role in this.

**Regional growth fund  
**The Department for Transport is contributing around a third of the funding for the £1.4bn Regional Growth Fund. Bids for local transport schemes that unlock sustainable economic growth will be eligible for submission to this fund.

**Highways maintenance   
**With limited resources available, the Department believes that it is essential that we continue to prioritise highways maintenance, reflecting its economic and social importance to local communities and safeguarding the largest single local public asset. 

We are therefore providing over £3 billion over the next four years. This takes account of the significant scope for efficiencies, for example through combining purchasing power of local authorities to drive down prices. 

To help local authorities achieve these efficiencies, we will work with local government professionals to embed sector-led best practice widely, with a time-limited fund worth £3 million in each of 2011/12 and 2012/13.

**Integrated transport block  
**DfT intends to provide over £1.3bn over four years for small transport improvements, on top of the capital funding provided through the Local Sustainable Transport Fund and in addition to what is available through the Regional Growth Fund. 

Integrated transport block funding (£450 million in 2010-11) is crucial to help local authorities improve road safety, stimulate local economies by reducing congestion, and deliver social justice to their local communities. Research has shown that investment in such measures can provide very high value for money. 

The funding will be allocated according to a needs-based formula agreed with local authorities. In line with our principles of localism, local authorities will be able to spend ITB funding based on their own priorities. 

While this represents a reduction on the very high recent levels of ITB funding, taken together with capital funding from the Local Sustainable Transport Fund authorities will share an average £400m per year over the next four years.

**Local authority PFI  
**DfT has re-assessed local transport PFI schemes in development or procurement and identified those that can proceed, taking into account value for money, affordability and their relative stage of development. 

Our intention is to proceed with the remaining schemes from the 2nd round of the Streetlighting programme, subject to them remaining value for money. These are:

- Knowsley  
- Oldham and Rochdale  
- Croydon and Lewisham  
- Eastern Shires (Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire)

We also intend to proceed with PFI projects to extend the Nottingham tram network with two new lines and deliver sustained improvements in highways maintenance in Sheffield, Hounslow and the Isle of Wight. As resources are tight, government needs to ensure that every pound is spent to the maximum benefit. We will therefore be working urgently with the four local authorities to establish how we can deliver these projects affordably. 

It is important that PFI schemes are subject to the same spending scrutiny as other schemes. The previously approved and subsequently suspended 3rd round of Streetlighting schemes can no longer be supported, saving £1.1bn over the life of the projects. These are:

- Hertfordshire  
- Essex  
- Kirklees  
- Warrington  
- Gloucestershire  
- Durham with Stockton

### Local resource:

Including concessionary travel, overall we will make 28 per cent savings from local transport revenue funding, in line with the wider revenue savings that the Department is making from its overall budget for transport. 

**Concessionary travel**   
We are committed to protecting the England-wide concessionary travel scheme for older and disabled people. So while we have identified substantial efficiency savings in this area, they are focused on the way the scheme is administered, rather than on the benefits received.

**Bus service operators grant (BSOG)**   
From 2012-13, DfT plans to make a reduction in the subsidy paid to bus operators by reducing the rate at which subsidy is paid by 20%. The incentives for smartcards, low carbon buses and automatic vehicle location will be maintained.

The current non-statutory arrangements that enable long distance coach operators to claim BSOG in return for offering a half price concession to older and disabled people will be ended by October 2011, although the industry may wish to continue to offer this on a commercial basis. This does not in any way affect the statutory national concession which offers free travel on local bus services throughout England. 

We are considering options for the long-term future distribution of bus subsidy and will make an announcement in due course. 

### Annex D - Environment

The Department for Transport remains committed to delivering on the Government's environmental objectives. We will stop non-essential research activities, and refocus our research programmes particularly on those projects which directly support the development of a green economy, and which deliver robust information to guide our policy making and international negotiations.

We have made the following tough choices:

- We are committing no new funding for any further DfT ""Act on CO2"" advertising campaigns. We do not believe that spending millions on advertising and marketing would be appropriate or sustainable in the current economic climate. Existing material continues to be available via the Government Act on CO2 website. 

- We will require efficiency savings from both the Energy Saving Trust and Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership. We believe that these reductions are challenging, but sensible and sustainable, and will not affect the carbon savings that the programmes will drive.

- The functions of the Renewable Fuels Agency are being transferred to the Department for Transport. The DfT will work with the RFA to consider how best to achieve this transition and to ensure that potential administrative savings are realised.

This has allowed us to focus financial support on key priorities that will reduce transport emissions and support low carbon economy growth. These include:

- making provision for over £400m for measures to promote the uptake of ultra-low carbon vehicle technologies. These include: 

- supporting consumer incentives for electric and other low emission cars throughout the life of this Parliament. We will continue to monitor the most effective way to deliver this investment, with the first review of the Plug In Car grant in 2012;

- continued investment in electric vehicle recharging infrastructure (Plugged In Places);

- research and development.

- supporting the key elements of the carbon-saving transport programmes that are delivered by the Energy Saving Trust and Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership, while working with both organisations to achieve efficiencies. Details will be confirmed shortly. 

### Annex E - Drivers

**Road Safety **  
As part of the simplification and radical devolution of local government finance, the Coalition Government will no longer be providing a specific ring-fenced grant to support road safety delivery and enforcement - including camera enforcement - at local level. This funding stream is being wrapped up into the wider local government funding settlement, and allocated by formula. These reforms will give greater autonomy and flexibility to local authorities in deciding how best to tackle their road safety problems. Additionally, the Local Sustainable Transport Fund will offer local authorities the opportunity to bid for funding for schemes offering safety as well as other local benefits. 

Nationally, we are reducing the resources allocated to road safety research and marketing, distributing more of the available money instead for use in local targeted initiatives. We will reduce the THINK! budget by £12m per annum by 2014/15, so we will be focusing national marketing activity on those road users which represent the highest risks to others, and for whom a marketing approach is proven to be effective. We will also be making full use of lower cost mechanisms - such as social networking and the new educational courses - to target delivery cost-effectively and working closely with commercial partners to communicate key road safety messages. This approach has already proved successful; for example, 32,000 motorcyclists have joined a THINK! BIKER Facebook page launched earlier this year.

**Freight**  
As set out above, the Department will undertake a study to identify cost effective and practical proposals to relieve congestion on the key A14 freight corridor.

We are making savings to the freight research budget, focusing on priority issues such as carbon reduction. These total £1m.

We will target our available resources on roadside enforcement of HGVs and drivers who pose the biggest risk to road safety. 

### Annex F - Aviation, maritime and security

We are seeking to ensure that policy objectives can be met within a reduced budget by taking a more focused approach to delivery in line with the following principles: 

- extending the ""user pays"" principle - by shifting costs and responsibility for certain activities to the most appropriate body. Sometimes that will be the industry itself, sometimes the independent regulator, such as, the Civil Aviation Authority, where they might fit more logically;

- being more efficient - for example ensuring our resources are focused firmly on UK priorities and eliminating overlaps in UK representation at international meetings;

- making the Overseas Territories more accountable for the cost of their own aviation safety; and, 

- limiting the spend on aviation research through better targeting of our research programmes. 

Passenger safety remains our highest priority, and transport security continues to play a key role in the Government's wider counter-terrorism strategy. We intend to use the opportunity of the Spending Review to explore ways of maintaining and improving security standards by modernising our approach to regulation.

The MCA will no longer provide Emergency Towing Vessels (ETVs) at taxpayers' expense from September 2011. Emergency towing vessels are mainly deployed when vessels break down. The Government believes state provision of ETVs does not represent a correct use of taxpayers money and that ship salvage should be a commercial matter between a ship's operator and the salvor. Removing ETVs will save £32.5m over the Spending Review period.

The Maritime Incident Response Group (MIRG) will be reviewed. The MIRG was formed to respond to incidents at sea for which firefighting, chemical hazard and/or rescue teams may be required. The teams are drawn from 15 Fire and Rescue Services and since the MIRG teams began operating in 2006 they have not been involved in any significant incidents. All ships' crews are trained in basic firefighting techniques and there is little evidence that MIRG has changed the outcome of ship fires. A consultation will follow on the detailed proposals but it is estimated that ending all the MIRG would save the Department £340,000 annually.
