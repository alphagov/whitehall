## Key points

  * On 31 March 2012, the estimated number of valid Blue Badges held was 2.62 million, a decrease of 1.1 per cent from the revised figure of 2.65 million for the previous year, which was the highest annual figure recorded. This is the first year to experience a decline since 1997.
  * Of this total, 37 per cent were issued under the 'without further assessment' criteria, 62 per cent were issued under the 'subject to further assessment' criteria and 1 per cent were issued to organisations. These proportions have remained broadly similar since 1997.
  * On 31 March 2012, 5.0 per cent of the English population held a valid Blue Badge, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points from 2011.
  * In 2011/12, the estimated number of Blue Badges issued in England was 905 thousand, a decrease of 3.4 per cent from the previous year.
  * The overall reduction in number of badges held between 2011 and 2012 has been driven by a decline of 4.3 per cent in the number of badges issued under the 'subject to further assessment' criteria in the last year.

## Key points

  * In 2011, total freight traffic through UK ports was 519 million tonnes (Mt), an increase of 1 per cent on 2010, but still 11 per cent below the 2005 level. The traffic handled by UK ports has generally grown fairly steadily over the long term. The first decade of the 21st century saw a levelling off of this trend, albeit with the highest ever traffic recorded in 2005. This was followed by a substantial drop of 11 per cent between 2008 and 2009 with the onset of the recession.
  * Compared with 2010, inwards traffic increased by 5 per cent to 328 Mt, whilst outwards traffic decreased by 4 per cent to 192 Mt.
  * Grimsby and Immingham remained the UK's leading port in 2011, handling 57 Mt (11 per cent of UK traffic). It was followed by London with 48.8 MT (9 per cent), Milford Haven with 48.7 Mt (9 per cent) and Southampton with 38 Mt (7 per cent).
  * In 2011, UK major ports handled 15.3 million freight units, almost unchanged compared with 2010. They also handled 6.0 million passenger vehicles, a decrease of 4 per cent on 2010.
  * Dover, the top UK port for roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) freight, handled 2 million ro-ro main freight units (road goods vehicles, unaccompanied trailers and shipborne port-to-port trailers).
  * Felixstowe was the UK's largest container port handling 2 million containers.

## Key points

Key findings from the RRCGB 2011 report include:

  * In 2011, there were a total of 203,950 casualties of all severities in road accidents reported to the police, 2 per cent lower than in 2010. There were 1,901 people killed, a 3 per cent increase than in 2010 and 23,122 were seriously injured, up 2 per cent. Motor vehicle traffic increased slightly (0.2 per cent) over the same period.
  * The number of fatalities fell for three types of road user, with a fall of 22 per for bus and coach occupants, 10 per cent for motor cyclists, 4 per cent for pedal cyclists. Pedestrian and Car occupants rose by 12 and 6 per cent respectively.
  * In 2011, it is estimated 9,990 reported casualties (5 per cent of all road casualties) occurred when someone was driving whilst over the legal alcohol limit. The provisional number of people estimated to have been killed in drink drive accidents was 280 (15 per cent of all road fatalities).
  * The rate per billion vehicle miles for total casualties in reported road accidents and the rate of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) in 2011 were both 15 per cent lower than the 2005-09 average. For fatalities alone, the 2011 rate was 32 per cent lower than the average.
  * Failed to look properly was again the most frequently reported contributory factor and was reported in 42 per cent of all accidents reported to the police in 2011.
  * In 2011, the economic welfare cost of reported road accidents was estimated to be around £15.6 billion.

## Key points

  * In the year ending June 2012; 1,790 people were killed in reported road accidents, a 6 per cent drop from the year ending June 2011 (1,901). However, the number of people killed or seriously injured in the year ending June 2012 rose to 24,870, a 1 per cent increase compared with the year ending June 2011 (24,610).
  * Comparing Q2 2012 against Q2 2011 shows a 6 per cent fall in total deaths and serious injuries, and an 18 per cent fall in deaths alone. However, in general, single quarter comparisons should be treated with caution as data are more subject to distortion by short-term factors such as extreme weather. Q2 2012 saw extremely wet weather across England, which may affect comparison with earlier years.
  * Overall for year ending June 2012; there were 148,100 reported injury accidents and 199,740 reported casualties of any severity (slight injuries, serious injuries and fatalities), falls of 3 per cent and 4 per cent respectively from to the year ending June 2011 figures. In comparison, motor vehicle traffic levels have risen by 0.1 per cent in the year ending June 2012.

## Key points

  * The total road length in Great Britain in 2011 was estimated to be 245.0 thousand miles, an increase of 2.1 thousand miles (0.9 per cent) over 10 years.
  * Minor roads made up 87 per cent of total road length, with motorways and 'A' roads accounting for 1 per cent and 12 per cent respectively.
  * Despite accounting for only 13 per cent of road length in 2011, major roads (motorways and 'A' roads) accounted for 65 per cent of road traffic.
  * The trunk road network (centrally managed motorways and 'A' roads) accounted for 7.5 thousand miles, a decrease of 1.7 thousand miles since 2001. This decrease reflects the government's de-trunking program (the transfer of centrally managed roads to local authorities).

## Key points

  * There were 34.6 million vehicles licensed for use on the roads in Great Britain on the 30th June 2012. Of these vehicles, 28.7 million were cars. The all vehicle figure represents a 0.5 per cent increase on the quarter 2 2011 figure.

Source: [VEH0101](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/statistics/tables/veh0101.xls)

  * The prevailing economic situation has a noticeable influence on trends in the number of licensed vehicles, especially commercial vehicles. The numbers of licensed Heavy Goods Vehicles and Buses & Coaches have been on a generally downward trend since the economic downturn began in 2008/09, and the rate of increase in other types of vehicles has slowed.

Source: [VEH0101](http://assets.dft.gov.uk/statistics/tables/veh0101.xls)

  * A total of 604.9 thousand vehicles were registered for the first time in Great Britain during quarter 2 2012. This represents a 3.8 per cent increase in the number of first registrations from quarter 2 2011. There have now been four consecutive quarters on year-on-year increases, of which the latest is the largest. In general, however, first registration numbers have been on a downward trend since 2002.
  * During quarter 2 2012 a total of 961 new ultra-low emission vehicles was registered for the first time (in the UK as a whole). The number of cars and quadricycles was 728, up from 366 in quarter 2 2011. Of these, 473 were cars eligible for the DfT's Plug-in Vehicle Grant.
  * Average CO2 emissions from new cars fell from 134.7 g/km in quarter 1 2012 to 133.2 g/km in quarter 2 2012.
  * The most popular car registered for the first time during the first half of 2012 was the Ford Fiesta, with almost 58 thousand new registrations. The Vauxhall Corsa was the second most popular with 46 thousand registrations, followed by the Ford Focus (43 thousand), Volkswagen Golf (35 thousand) and Vauxhall Astra (30 thousand).

This publication presents statistics on the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for the obligation year 15 April 2012 to 14 July 2012 (Year 5).

It includes information on:

  * the amount of UK road transport fuel from renewable and fossil fuel;
  * the number of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) which have been issued to sustainable renewable fuel;
  * the balance of RTFCs by obligation period;
  * trades of RTFCs between suppliers and/or traders; and,
  * carbon and sustainability (C&S) characteristics of the renewable fuel supplied.

### The headline figures are:

  * 6.3 billion litres of renewable transport fuel have been supplied in the 51 months since the RTFO began.

### In the first quarter of Year 5 of the RTFO (14 April 2012 to 15 July 2012):

  * 321 million litres of renewable fuel have been supplied, which is 2.9% of total road transport fuel reported to the RTFO Administrator against an annual obligation of 4.5%.
  * More bioethanol (60%) has been supplied than biodiesel (36%). There were also small volumes of biogas, biomethanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and pure vegetable oil.
  * 154 million RTFCs have been issued of which 69 million were for double counting feedstocks.

### C&S characteristics of the biofuels to which RTFCs have been issued (37% of the total biofuel)1:

  * The largest proportion of renewable fuel was derived from non-European Community corn (66 million litres, 55% of total biofuel to which RTFCs have been issued). The most widely reported source (by feedstock and country of origin) for biodiesel was used cooking oil from the USA (8 million litres, 31% of biodiesel to which RTFCs have been issued). The most widely sourced bioethanol was corn from the United States of America (65 million litres, 76% of bioethanol to which RTFCs have been issued).
  * 11% of renewable fuel was sourced from UK feedstocks.
  * An aggregate greenhouse gas saving of 59% compared to fossil fuels was achieved. This figure excludes emissions from indirect land-use change.

1 The final deadline for applying for RTFCs is 12 August following the obligation period.

## Key points

  * There were 730 UK owned trading vessels, totalling 20.5 million gross tons, or 22.5 million deadweight tons. Of these 730 vessels, 162 were tankers, 140 were ro-ro vessels, 114 were container ships and 78 were bulk carriers.
  * 930 trading vessels were UK parent owned, totalling 27.2 million gross tons and 35.2 million deadweight.
  * 1,228 trading ships were UK managed, totalling 49.4 million gross tons or 63.8 million deadweight tons.
  * All three of these fleets, as well as the UK Registered fleet, have grown substantially over the previous decade. However, growth has generally levelled off over the last 2-3 years, and the size of the UK parent owned fleet declined after 2008, although it partly recovered in 2011.
  * The world trading fleet at the end of 2011 consisted of over 55,000 vessels, totalling 983 million gross tons, or 1.47 billion tons deadweight.
