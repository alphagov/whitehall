Consultation document on the Traffic Signs (Amendment) Regulations and General Directions 2010 and the Traffic Signs (Temporary Obstruction) Regulations 2010.

## Further information

Please note that the Consultation Document and the draft Impact Assessment have been updated from those originally issued on 17 September.

The closing date for this consultation has also been extended to 24 December 2009. The Consultation Document has been revised to clarify the proposals for savings for signs that are being withdrawn - see page 17.

The Impact Assessment has been revised to include the Traffic Signs (Temporary Obstructions) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 in the title.

It has also been revised to reflect the fact that the draft Statutory Instruments apply to Scotland as well as England and Wales. No changes have been made to the draft Statutory Instruments or to the consultation proposals.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2010-02,Electrically assisted pedal cycles consultation,Consultation on the use of electrically assisted pedal cycles.,"## Summary

The specification of EAPCs, for use in Great Britain, is currently regulated by The Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycles Regulations 1983. These Regulations concern the specification and performance limits for EAPCs. The introduction of revised harmonised European construction rules for powered two wheel vehicles in 2002, and the recent introduction of a European Standard for EAPCs created a mismatch between the European requirements and the current GB Regulations, causing confusion for both industry and consumers. The changes to legislation proposed in this consultation will address the mismatch and, in the main, provide a simplification of existing legislation.

The Department's objective in amending the 1983 Regulations is to find a solution that is in line with the Government's commitment to better regulation and simplification of legislation. The changes should maintain the level of safety provided for under the Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycles Regulations 1983 whilst ensuring consistency with the European approach.

## Statement on next steps

A summary of responses to the Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycle (EAPC) consultation is provided in the following document.

The Department for Transport has considered the responses to this consultation and supports a move to harmonise power limits (from 200 Watts to 250 Watts) with similar provisions in place across the EU - allowing consumers access to a wider range of electrically assisted cycles.

The Department will develop regulatory proposals to update power limits and consider including other amendments, for example on weight limits once EU discussions on a much wider group of 2, 3 and light 4-wheeled vehicles conclude. The outcome of these discussions could have implications for our EAPC rules and it would therefore be unhelpful to make amendments at this time which might need to be repealed subsequently.

The Act introduces a power for DSA to suspend the approval of driving instructors in rare situations where the individual poses a danger to the public, usually where the instructor is:

  * convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence
  * delivering tuition of a dangerously low level

Before the suspension power can be used, a compensation scheme must be in place for instructors whose approval to instruct is suspended but not subsequently revoked.

The proposals in the paper relate to the system for calculating levels of awards and procedures for making claims - including timescales, supporting documentation, validation of information and appeals arrangements.

## The consultation

Following the consultation on an Exceptional Hardship Scheme, the Secretary of State has confirmed that an Exceptional Hardship Scheme will be introduced, and that it will be open to applications from Friday 20 August. This section includes the written ministerial statement to Parliament, frequently asked questions and an analysis of the responses to the consultation. Further information please see [High Speed Two - Proposed Exceptional Hardship Scheme](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/highspeedrail/exceptionalhardshipscheme/analysisofresponses/).

**The deadline for consultation responses on the Exceptional Hardship Scheme for a proposed high speed line from London to the West Midlands was been extended by four weeks to 17 June**.

The Secretary of State for Transport has taken this decision in the light of representations arguing that ten weeks is not sufficient to allow all those with an interest to have the fullest possible opportunity to comment on these proposals.

Alongside this, and without prejudice to the outcome of the consultation, the Department for Transport will ensure that shadow arrangements are put in place so that, should a decision be taken to proceed with the Scheme, applications can begin to be considered immediately. By bringing forward the timescale for applications in this way, this should help minimise uncertainty for those affected and ensure any payments can be made as quickly as possible wherever appropriate.

Anyone whose application is considered under such shadow arrangements would also have a right of appeal once the formal scheme is up and running.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/gov-20100526,The Coalition: our programme for government on transport,Government's response to the public comments received on 'The Coalition: Our programme for government on transport'.,"## Consultation responses

This is our response to the public comments received on [The Coalition: Our programme for government on transport.](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100919110641/http://programmeforgovernment.hmg.gov.uk/transport/index.html)

Thank you for the wide range of comments on the transport elements of the programme for government, by far the largest number of which were focused on proposals for a high speed rail network and broadly fell into three themes: what role will the high speed train fulfil in the UK; what route will the line follow; and, what consultation will there be.

Our vision is of a truly national high speed rail network for the whole of Britain. We believe it can play a significant role in promoting a low carbon economy thereby helping to make our country greener and more sustainable. We believe it will be a transformational project that will revolutionise travel between our major cities and will almost eliminate the need for internal domestic flights. This is supported by the detailed work already carried out by High Speed Two Ltd. Investment in high speed rail would not come at the expense of conventional lines, but would help relieve passenger congestion on existing routes.

To establish a high speed network that delivers the most significant benefits for the country, we will look carefully at how it can be linked up with major airports such as Heathrow, and will consider how it can also link to the international high speed network via High Speed 1 and the Channel Tunnel. It also means making sure that we take appropriate steps to balance the national interest in developing a new high speed line with its potential impact on the local environment and communities. It is important that all those with an interest in high speed rail have the opportunity to make their views known, so no final decisions will be taken until after a full public consultation on both our proposed strategy for high speed rail and on the route that any new line might take. We expect to begin such a consultation in the New Year.

The responses also confirmed the continuing priority given to road safety. Our programme for government promotes a balanced approach to road safety. We will stop central government funding for new fixed speed cameras and switch to more effective ways of making our roads safer, including authorising 'drugalyser' technology. Responses identified a wide range of possible solutions to road safety problems, and we will be reflecting these ideas as we develop our forward programme of road safety activity later in the year.

We also received some constructive ideas for improving our transport provision and have set out these below with our response:

  * Advertising traffic orders on the internet as well as in the press - we will look to give Local Authorities more flexibility in how they advertise their Orders and will investigate how we could abolish the need for many traffic regulation Orders.
  * Turning off motorway lights at times of low usage - we have started to run trials on this on the M6 and will look to extend it further soon.
  * Cutting down the number of repeater traffic signals - we agree local authorities should cut back on unnecessary traffic signs and signal and we will make sure our street design advice gives them practical ideas for doing this safely.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/gov-20110520,Road transport Red Tape Challenge,"Consultation for all road users, businesses, and local authorities on rules and regulations they would like scrapped or simplified .","The Red Tape Challenge is a government-wide process to get rid of unnecessary, burdensome and overcomplicated regulation.

Earlier this year, every secondary regulation relating to road transportation was put forward for discussion.

  * [Red Tape Challenge road transportation theme](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/road-transportation/)

As a result of suggestions from the public the Department is proposing to scrap, merge, simplify, amend or improve 142 (well over a third) of these regulations. Amongst the measures being pursued are:

  * Scrapping the regulation requiring motorists to hold a paper counterpart to their driving licence by 2015 - saving drivers up to £8m.
  * Improving the regulation surrounding the notification process for vehicles that are not in use on the road (Statutory Off Road Notification or SORN). Once drivers have notified the DVLA that their vehicle is SORN, they will no longer have the burden of annual SORN renewal.
  * Only issuing hard-copies of V5C vehicle registration certificates for fleet operators when needed (with the potential to offer the same to private motorists).
  * Introducing a limited exemption from drivers' hours rules so that those who also drive as Territorial Army reservists in their own time can continue to do so.

The Challenge also considered various measures that are not based in legislation and examined pieces of primary legislation that can be amended or simplified. Other proposals include:

  * Removing the need for an insurance certificate. The Department for Transport will work with the insurance industry on removing the need for motorists to have to hold an insurance certificate.
  * Abolishing the requirement for drivers to prove they have insurance when applying for tax, meaning 600,000 more people will be able to tax their car online. This has been made possible by new checks of existing databases for insurance under new Continuous Insurance Enforcement rules. (The DVLA's records are now compared regularly with the Motor Insurance Database (MID) to identify registered keepers of vehicles that appear to have no insurance).
  * We will look at experience in other countries on driver Certificates of Professional Competence (CPC) - the qualification for professional bus, coach and lorry drivers. In particular, to see if we could remove the need for some sectors, such as farmers who drive stock to market, from needing a CPC.
  * Local Authorities will now have to ensure business interests are properly considered as part of any future proposed Workplace Parking Levy scheme. They must show they have properly and effectively consulted local businesses, have addressed any proper concerns raised and secured support from the local business community.
  * Abolishing the regulations on the treatment of lost property on buses. Bus companies currently have to wait 48 hours before they can throw away perishable items left on the bus.

The Government believes that a national high speed rail network offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform the way we travel in Britain.

On 28 February 2011 the Government launched a national consultation, _High speed rail: Investing in Britain's future_. The consultation set out the Government's proposed strategy for a national high speed rail network for Britain and the route for an initial line between London and the West Midlands.

The consultation asked seven questions, covering the Government's overall strategy, the proposed route for the London to West Midlands line, the environmental appraisal of this line, and options for supporting property owners affected by the proposals. The consultation closed on 29 July 2011.

Where exemptions are granted, there is a legal obligation to publish them in the respective GB and NI versions of the Carriage of Dangerous Goods: Approved Derogations and Transitional Provisions (AD&TP). This document needs updating to remove obsolete derogations and recognise new ones.

In addition, there are proposed changes to the transitional provisions regarding the inspection of certain tanks and mobile explosive manufacturing units (MEMUs) which also require amendments to the AD&TP.

The purpose of this consultation paper is to seek views on:

  * the description we are proposing to include in the AD&TP to explain the meaning and purpose of those particular derogations;
  * the accompanying explanation for the updated transitional provisions covering the inspection of certain tanks;
  * the accompanying explanation for the new transitional provisions covering the inspection of MEMUs;
  * the proposal to consolidate the separate NI and GB versions of the AD&TP into one single document covering the United Kingdom (UK); and
  * other minor changes that have been made.

This document takes forward the Government's 'in principle' decision announced on 3 February 2011 to reform the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) scheme so that it better protects consumers in the 21st century holiday market and to put the scheme's finances back on a self-sustaining footing, allowing the current Government guarantee to be withdrawn.

The document is in two main parts. The first sets out further details of the reforms that can be implemented by new secondary legislation, seeking stakeholders' views on a number of detailed issues. The second part seeks stakeholders' broader views on potential medium to longer term reforms to the ATOL scheme including areas where new primary legislation would be needed. The consultation runs for 3 months, and ends on 15 September 2011.

## Government response to the consultation

This document summarises the 82 responses received from a range of stakeholders and sets out the Government's decisions on the reforms consulted on.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/gov-20110809,Red Tape Challenge,Regulatory enforcement has been placed on the Red Tape Challenge website aiming to reducing bureaucracy.,"## Respond to the consultation

Regulatory enforcement has been placed on the [Red Tape Challenge regulatory enforcement theme ](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/enforcement/) - a Government-wide website aimed at reducing bureaucracy - the public and businesses are invited to tell us what's working and what's not, what can be simplified and what can be scrapped.

Based on your feedback we will start getting rid of unnecessary red tape.

Reducing the number of rules and regulations in our national life is absolutely central to the coalition's vision for Britain, removing barriers to economic growth and increasing individual freedoms.

Every few weeks the Government is publishing the regulations affecting one specific sector or industry, on the Red Tape Challenge website.

Regulatory enforcement will be featured until 16 September 2011.

These regulations will transpose Article 21(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC, the ""Renewable Energy Directive"" (RED). The Article requires that where transport fuels (for all modes) contain more than 10% biofuel by volume, this should be indicated at sales points.

Implementation of Article 21(1) of the Directive will help to inform consumers whose vehicles may not be suited for higher levels of biofuel. Furthermore, it will allow consumers with compatible vehicles to identify fuels with high biofuel content more easily.

Our current system places significant financial burdens on the aviation industry along with inconvenience to passengers, and is not consistent with the Government's better regulation principles.

These proposals offer a new regime which maintains and improves security standards but in a more efficient and passenger-friendly way.

This consultation will be of most interest to the aviation security industry including airports and airlines.

**This consultation closed on the 7 November 2011.** Thank you to everyone who took the time to respond. We are now considering all responses to produce a summary report which will be published in due course.

The RTFO Order is being amended to implement the transport elements of the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED). This means that there will be a number of significant changes relating to the reporting of both biofuel volumes supplied to the UK and the carbon and sustainability (C&S) data associated with these fuels. This consultation asks questions on the proposed RTFO Guidance. This guidance will come into effect from the date of RED implementation and cover the rest of Year Four of the RTFO. It is not anticipated that there will be further consultation on revised guidance for Year Five (15 April 2012 - 14 April 2013).

This is not a formal consultation and respondents should note that the consultation period is shorter than that of the Department's formal written consultations. This approach has been taken as this guidance is primarily of interest to a specialist audience and there is a need to deliver a working set guidance for suppliers and verifiers as soon as practical

http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/gov-20111110,Rail and maritime Red Tape Challenge,The Red Tape Challenge initiative to simplfy and reduce uneccessary regulation and bureaucracy reaches the maritime and rail sectors.,"The maritime and rail transportation systems are a key part of the UK's transport network. Effective regulation is required to allow maritime and rail transport to operate to their full potential.

This Red Tape Challenge theme will look at over 400 regulations in the maritime and rail sector, and covers a broad range of rules - from those concerning fares and licensing in the rail industry, through to those aimed at protecting the marine environment.

See what the [sector champions](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/maritime-and-rail-transport-sector-champions/) are saying about the Red Tape Challenge.

## Maritime

The Maritime Red Tape Challenge includes over 200 international and domestic regulations relating to the maritime sector to ensure that the UK's shipping, ports and waterways are operated in an efficient, safe, secure and sustainable manner.

  * [Maritime Red Tape Challenge](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/maritime/)

## Rail

Earlier this year, 198 secondary regulations relating to our railways were put forward for discussion.

  * [Red Tape Challenge rail transportation theme](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/themehome/maritime-and-rail)

Following a rigorous process of challenge within Whitehall, and following suggestions from the public, business and other stakeholders, the Department is proposing to scrap, simplify, amend and improve over forty per cent of these. Amongst the measures being pursued are:

  * streamlining the process for amending penalty fares;
  * harmonising and simplifying the process for obtaining an operating licence;
  * holding a review of the railway closure process;
  * reducing regulatory burdens and costs on historic cableways;
  * merging a number of regulations to make them easier to understand;
  * removing a significant number of lapsed or redundant regulations.

This consultation paper is about updating the existing arrangements for providing training courses under the Drink-Drive Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS), including the funding arrangements.

The proposals contained in this consultation paper build on the government policy recently announced in the Strategic Framework for Road Safety in seeking to maintain the downward trend in road deaths and casualties by delivering an improved educational intervention for convicted drivers. They relate to improving the arrangements for the provision of DDRS courses.

The aim is that these proposals will create better quality courses which will encourage more offenders to take advantage of the training in order to reduce the likelihood of them re-offending.

## Consultation response

The Department is working with local authorities, industry and the public to improve the A14. In December 2011, we launched the A14 Challenge, seeking views from all stakeholders on the best solutions to the issues on this road. 'The A14 Challenge: Finding solutions together' outlines the ideas suggested by stakeholders, and sets out how we are using these to develop solutions for the A14. Alongside this, we are publishing the phase 2 reports for the A14 Study, which sets out some interim conclusions and recommendations - these will be followed up in phase 3 of the study, which will finalise its recommendations in July.

We are inviting views on proposals to remove the current need for the Secretary for State to approve local authority applications to run 'permit schemes', which enable authorities to better manage street works.

These works are a necessary fact of life and essential to give and support the utility and transport services on which individuals and businesses depend, but they also cause significant disruption to road users and local communities. The Government is determined to cut the adverse impacts of these works.

The consultation will run from 31 January 2012 for 12 weeks closing on 25 April 2012.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-05,Consultation on Street Works qualifications,Consultation to remove the current requirement for street works operatives and supervisors to hold specific qualifications.,"## Summary

We are inviting views on proposals arising from the Red Tape Challenge to remove the current requirement for street works operatives and supervisors to hold specific qualifications, and instead allow employers to determine suitable training. The Government believes this would end the inappropriate 'layering' of regulations, given that safety and reinstatement standards are already regulated by statutory codes of practice.

The consultation will run from 8 March 2012 for 12 weeks closing on 31 May 2012.

The Department would like to introduce new secondary legislation which will allow Ministers to selectively relax the application of EU cabotage rules in GB - specifically aimed at non-GB car transporters at the peak car registration periods. The relaxation of the rules would mean that such vehicles would not be liable to enforcement action if they broke the EU cabotage rules during the designated peak periods.

These amendments concern enforcement of the offence of keeping a vehicle without minimum third party insurance. The amendments are required to meet the concerns of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments (JCSI) that the 2011 Regulations delegate to the custodian of an impounded vehicle (DVLA/ their contractor) the power to determine the vehicle owner if more than one party claims ownership. The amendments solely address JCSI concerns and would not alter enforcement practice as they only remove a power which was not there in the first place.

Unlike many of the bodies scheduled for abolition under the Public Bodies Act 2011 (""the Act""), it has always been the intention to wind-up BRB (Residuary) Ltd (BRBR) at the appropriate time. That time is now at hand and the Act provides the most efficient means by which to achieve the winding-up of BRBR.

Since BRBR (Company No: 04146505) was established in 2001, the Company has pursued with vigour its remit of extracting value from the disparate portfolio of assets and liabilities inherited from the British Railways Board. By the date of abolition BRBR will have disposed of more than 90% of its inherited property assets and in doing so will have generated over £400m by way of sales proceeds. Over this period of time BRBR has also expedited and reduced the cost of handling industrial injury and disease claims from former employees, and acted in support of various government policy initiatives. This has included developing former railway offices in order to provide accommodation for civil servants.

However, it is no longer viable given the reduced scale of BRBR's activities to maintain BRBR as a separate corporate entity. It is therefore proposed that BRBR be abolished and its functions, properties, rights and liabilities transferred to a combination of the Secretary of State for Transport (the Secretary of State), London & Continental Railways (LCR), Network Rail (NR) and Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB).

The Act includes a requirement in Section 10 for consultation in respect of all proposals which require an Order to be made under Sections 1 to 5 of the Act. As the impact of the proposed reform is neutral the Department for Transport (DfT) is undertaking a targeted six week informal consultation. This meets the consultation requirements for a body with specialised functions and a limited user group. This consultation is therefore seeking views on the proposed abolition of BRBR and on the transfer of its functions, property, rights and liabilities to the Secretary of State, LCR, NR, and RSSB.

The period for consultation over the proposed abolition of BRB (Residuary) Limited, which commenced on 15 May, was extended by 2 weeks to 9 July for a small number of respondents who asked for additional time to comment on the proposals. The Department is required to publish its response within 6 weeks of the close of consultation which, as a result of this extension, will now be by 21 August.

The Government's goal for rail fares and ticketing is to allow more passengers to travel and to have a better experience of rail, at the same time as reducing rail industry costs.

This consultation is designed to gather evidence to inform the Government's Rail Fares and Ticketing Review.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-10,Rail decentralisation: devolving decision-making on passenger rail services in England,"Most train services in England are specified, funded and managed centrally by the Department for Transport based in London. ","## Summary

Most train services in England are specified, funded and managed centrally by the Department for Transport based in London. Passenger Transport Executives' (PTEs) and local authorities' influence over the rail services provided in their local area is limited.

In line with its aspirations for localism, the Government is seeking to devolve, where appropriate, more accountability and decision-making related to local rail services to sub-national bodies, such as local authorities and PTEs. This consultation explores how this might be done in parts of England.

### Why we are consulting

The Government wishes to seek views on whether improved outcomes for transport users might be achieved in some cases if more decisions relating to local rail services were made closer to the communities they serve.

We are also inviting sub-national bodies - PTEs and local authorities - to indicate their interest and come forward with outline proposals for taking on decision-making responsibility for passenger rail services in their area.

This consultation complements the Command Paper, Reforming Our Railways, published today. That sets out the Government's vision for rail and responds to Sir Roy McNulty's independent report on value for money on the railways

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has undertaken to review the UK's Merchant Shipping legislation in line with meeting the requirements laid down in the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006. The MCA will be running a series of consultations on these regulatory packages. Each consultation package seeks views on the MCA's proposals for the new respective Merchant Shipping Regulations. This is the first package of consultations and covers:

  * Title 2.6 and 4.2 Shipowner liability (see link under Title 4 below)
  * Title 3.1 Crew accommodation
  * Title 3.2 Food and catering
  * Title 4.1 Medical care

The public consultation document sets out proposals for giving full effect to the Regulations and Standards of the ILO Maritime Labour Convention 2006. This requires amendments to the existing Merchant Shipping legislation as identified below. The measures identified to implement the Convention have been discussed with social partners, through the MCA's MLC Tripartite Working Group.

The intention is to bring these regulations into force 12 months following ratification of the MLC.

A draft assessment of the costs and benefits of the proposals is in the Impact Assessment attached to each consultation package. We would welcome information to inform/support our estimates.

We propose to permit applications for a stopping-up or diversion order to be submitted at the same time as applying for planning permission for the proposed development (whereas under the existing legislation the developer can only apply after securing planning permission), and options for devolving decision-making to the local authority level.

The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) scheme requires suppliers of road transport fuel to ensure that a certain proportion of the fuel they supply comes from sustainable renewable sources. To ensure effective enforcement of the scheme the RTFO Administrator has powers to issue civil penalties.

The Government is proposing to amend the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 to put it beyond doubt that civil penalties issued under the scheme are enforceable as civil debts.

In May 2011 the Government published its [Strategic Framework for Road Safety](/publications/strategic-framework-for-road-safety/), which sets out a package of policies that would continue to reduce deaths and injuries on our roads. The road safety framework recognises the importance of targeted enforcement to tackle those behaviours that represent a risk to road safety. The measures announced in the road safety framework focus on making the enforcement process more efficient, ensuring that penalties are set at the right levels, and making educational training more widely available for low level offending.

This consultation seeks views on proposals announced in the road safety framework that support these objectives, namely making careless driving a fixed penalty notice offence and increasing the penalty levels for some motoring FPN offences. Both measures are linked in that the penalty level for the proposed careless driving offence will be set at the level being proposed for motoring fixed penalty offences, but are dealt with separately in the consultation document.

These proposals retain the important distinction between taxis - which can 'ply for hire' on the street or a cab rank - and private hire vehicles which can only be pre-booked.

But all vehicles would be subject to national minimum safety standards and, for private hire vehicles, these would replace more than 340 sets of local regulations. This will reduce the burden on business because, once appropriately licensed, a private hire firm could work freely across the country, without geographical restrictions. This would contribute to widening consumer choice and to making services cheaper and more competitive.

The Law Commission also make suggestions covering a wide range of issues, including improving provision for persons with disabilities, quantity restrictions and enforcement.

We are inviting views from all those with an interest on what successor arrangements should be put in place if DPTAC is abolished. We are seeking to ensure that any successor arrangement will continue to provide the Department with consensual, pan-disability advice in a flexible way, and that any arrangement represents value for money.

The cross-Government review of Non Department Public Bodies carried out in October 2010 concluded that reform was needed to increase accountability, reduce duplication of activity, improve transparency and discontinue obsolete activities. In line with the goals of this Review, the Department needs to ensure it continues to have access to specialist advice on the practical issues facing disabled people using the transport network.

The Department has developed a number of options for securing specialist advice on disability transport issues should the Department make an Order to abolish DPTAC.

This consultation seeks views on the UK's draft Statutory Instrument that transposes Regulation (EC) 392/2009. The Regulation gives effect, within the EU, to the 2002 Protocol to the Athens Convention to create parity for the passenger shipping industry and help ensure that UK citizens have access to the same levels of compensation when travelling between two different EU Member States. Furthermore, it increases the limits of liabilities for death or personal injuries to passengers being carried by sea; requires carriers to have compulsory insurance, and provides claimants with the right of taking direct action against the insurers. The intended effect is to provide an enhanced framework of compensation in the event of death or personal injury to a passenger, or the loss or damage to luggage when travelling on a sea journey. The Regulation also brings into scope certain domestic passenger services.

The EU Regulation on bus and coach passenger rights will apply in all Member States from 1 March 2013, primarily to long-distance regular services 250km or longer. Whilst the EU Regulation is directly applicable, Member States remain responsible for making decisions on several important issues. This public consultation therefore focuses on the use of available exemptions, enforcement arrangements and designating terminals where guaranteed assistance is provided to disabled passengers.

The Vehicles Crime Act (2001), among other things, provided the Vehicle Operator and Services Agency (VOSA) with the power to inspect ""written off"" vehicles where the cost of repairing exceeds the market value of the car. The Vehicle Identity Check (VIC) scheme was introduced in 2003.

The Department for Transport is seeking to determine the future of the VIC scheme and whether the scheme is fit for purpose. The following proposals are to be considered as part of this consultation:

  * Retain the scheme in its present format;
  * Re-scope the scheme;
  * Abolish the scheme.

http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/dft-2012-35,Draft Aviation Policy Framework,"This document sets out our draft sustainable framework for UK aviation (referred to as the ""Aviation Policy Framework"").","## Summary

The Government's primary objective is to achieve long-term economic growth. The aviation sector is a major contributor to the economy, and we support its growth within a framework which maintains a balance between the benefits of aviation and its costs, particularly climate change and noise.

This is especially important for those who live close to airports and bear a particular burden of the costs. We therefore want to strengthen the arrangements for involving communities near airports in decisions which affect them.

It is equally important that the aviation industry has confidence that the framework is sufficiently stable to underpin long-term planning and investment in aircraft and infrastructure.

### Why we are consulting

This document sets out our draft sustainable framework for UK aviation (referred to as the ""Aviation Policy Framework""). It is a consultation document and has been informed by the over 600 responses we received to our scoping document. It is a high-level strategy, setting out our overall objectives for aviation and our policies to achieve those objectives. It is underpinned by two core principles:

  * **Collaboration:** By working together with industry, regulators, experts, local communities and others at all levels - international, national and local - we believe we will be better able to identify workable solutions to challenges and share the benefits of aviation in a fairer way than in the past.
  * **Transparency:** To facilitate improved collaboration, it is crucial to have clear and independent information and processes in place - those involved in and affected by aviation need to have a clearer understanding of the facts and the confidence that proportionate action will be taken at the international, national or local level.

Please note that in this consultation, we are seeking views and information relating to the questions that follow. We intend to issue, later this year, a Call for Evidence on maintaining the UK's international connectivity. This will include an opportunity to comment on what, if any, new airport capacity may be required to meet the UK's needs in the medium and long term. If you wish to make such comments you are encouraged to wait until the Call for Evidence as these would be outside the scope of the current consultation.
