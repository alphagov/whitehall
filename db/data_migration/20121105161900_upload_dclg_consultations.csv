http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/businessratestechnical,Business Rates Retention: Technical Consultation,department-for-communities-and-local-government,Business rates retention: technical details,"This technical consultation builds on the proposals in the government response to consultation published in December 2011, and on the statements of intent published on 17 May 2012.

It seeks views on a range of detailed technical issues concerning practical implementation of those proposals, particularly focusing on how the Government proposes to calculate local authority start-up funding allocations, baseline funding levels as well as other parameters which are required for the setup and operation of the business rates retention scheme. As such, it will be of particular interest to local authority finance departments responsible for implementing and running the new scheme.

Section 2 focuses on establishing baseline funding levels for each local authority, as well as the methodology for allocating Revenue Support Grant which will be paid.

The December 2011 consultation response stated that, in the interests of maintaining as much stability as possible, these would be calculated on the basis of the 2012/13 formula grant process with updated data sets and some limited technical updates. This section details proposals for making those calculations and includes exemplifications of the proposed options. It also covers transfers and adjustments to the local government spending controls total and includes proposed methodologies for incorporating those separate grant funding streams being included in the business rates retention scheme from April 2013.

Section 3 outlines other parameters which need to be determined when setting up the business rates retention system - particularly in relation to establishing individual local authority business rate baselines.

Section 4 details proposals on how the system will operate once it has been set up. It is arranged chronologically, to give local authorities the best idea of how the scheme will operate year-by-year. The calculation of levy and safety net payments is set out in this section. The safety net will fall within the 7.5%-10% range and funded by a 1:1 levy as already announced.

Section 5 covers the proposed approach to closing the 2012-13 national non domestic rating account.

The Department has published a number of documents to supplement the technical consultation on business rates retention. These documents set out the proposed approach for the London share of business rates and an alternative option for funding the New Homes Bonus. In addition, the Department has published supplementary information on proportionate shares as well as population data. These documents can be found below.

The draft Local Audit Bill is now being published for consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny.

The draft Bill sets out the proposed new audit framework for local public bodies, the process for the appointment of auditors, and the regulatory framework for local public audit. Alongside this we are publishing proposals for the audit of smaller local public bodies (those bodies with a turnover of less than £6.5 million).

He invited local authorities to consult people, ask them how they would like to see their local area improved and to take appropriate action to make it happen. The Localism Act has given them far more freedom and flexibility to do this.

If local authorities, having consulted and reached agreement with their local communities, find that a bureaucratic barrier prevents them from taking action, they can submit a formal 'proposal' under the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 asking Government to remove the barrier through the online portal at [http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link). This portal is also open to anyone who wishes to ask the government to remove a barrier which is stopping local action.

  * blocking an owner's sale of their home - without justifiable reason
  * neglecting their sites and failing to make adequate repairs; and
  * charging excessive pitch fees, breaching site rules and stopping owners from improving their homes.

The measures are designed to ensure site operators who behave responsibly can continue to operate as they do already whilst the rogue operators are properly tackled - as well as being made to meet the cost of their negligence rather than the taxpayer picking up the bill.

The proposed changes include:

  * ensuring compliance with site licence conditions by enabling the courts to impose unlimited fines on operators who do not manage their sites properly
  * allowing local authorities to make a reasonable charge on site operators for their licensing services, which they are currently unable to do
  * giving local authorities the power to carry out works on sites in an emergency or where the site operator has been found guilty of a breach of the licence, and charge the cost back to them
  * strengthening the rules around the sale of mobile homes so that unscrupulous operators cannot interfere with owners selling to a qualifying buyer who they have chosen; and

Consultation on amendments to the 2011-12 housing revenue account subsidy determination, amendments to the 2011-12 item 8 determinations, and the item 8 determinations which will apply from April 2012, take place under powers conferred by sections 80 and 87 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989.

We are consulting on 5 draft determinations:

  * the settlement payments determination: this sets out the amount each local authority will either pay the government or receive from the Government on 28 March 2012 in order to exit the current subsidy system, and the way in which the payments will be made
  * the limit on indebtedness determination: this places a cap on the amount of housing debt each council may hold
  * the housing revenue account subsidy amendment determination for the year 2011-12: this adjusts the subsidy entitlement for this financial year in order to take account of the interest costs or savings arising from the settlement payments; these payments will be made before the end of the financial year
  * the item 8 credit and debt amendment determination for the year 2011-12: this enables the appropriate charges to be made between the housing revenue account and a council's general fund to reflect the borrowing costs or savings in this financial year arising from the settlement payments
  * the item 8 credit and debit determinations for 2012 onwards: these provide a framework for the housing revenue account ring-fence to continue to operate under a devolved system of funding

Alongside the draft determinations, we are publishing the spreadsheet models which have been used to calculate the self-financing valuations, settlement payments and debt limits set out in the determinations.

On 15 August, following the rioting and looting across England between 6 August and 10 August, the consultation was broadened to seek views on whether the existing discretionary ground for possession should be extended to include convictions for riot-related offences committed by the tenant or members of their household, wherever they took place within the United Kingdom.

In respect of the proposed new mandatory power, the consultation paper sought views on how this should be designed; the principles that should underpin it; in what circumstances landlords should be able to use the mandatory power; and, how often in practice they might seek possession using the mandatory power rather than on existing discretionary grounds.

He invited councils to consult people, ask them how they would like to see their local area improved and to take whatever action they see fit to make it happen.

If councils, having consulted and reached agreement with their local communities, find that a bureaucratic barrier prevents them from taking action, they can submit a formal 'proposal' asking government to remove the barrier through the online portal at [barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk](http://barrierbusting.communities.gov.uk/) (external link). This portal is also open to anyone who wishes to ask the government to remove a barrier which is stopping local action. We would, for example, welcome requests to remove barriers from organisations such as town and parish councils, and County Associations of Parish Councils.

The Act was amended in April 2010 to allow the procedures for receiving, considering and deciding proposals under the Act to be improved.

The Act now allows the arrangements for the consideration of proposals submitted in response to the invitation to be set out in regulations, following a period of consultation. There will be no deadlines for the submission of proposals, which can now be submitted straight to the government at any time. Information on the action the government is taking on the proposals will be available online so that councils and communities can track progress.

Responses to a December 2008 consultation: _Definition of zero carbon homes and non-domestic buildings_ recognised the case for regulation. However, in the light of current economic conditions, it is also important to consider the costs and potential consequences of such regulation on economic recovery for the construction sector and balance these with the benefits of early certainty around a route-map for future regulatory steps.

This consultation therefore sets out policy principles and further modelling work, and seeks views on these and their implications for viability for individual developments and sectors. The proposal to apply the zero carbon standard to new public sector buildings (including some Crown Estate buildings, which are exempt from Building Regulations) is discussed separately.",24-Nov-2009,26-Feb-2010,9781409820376,,,,improving-the-energy-efficiency-of-buildings-and-using-planning-to-protect-the-environment,,,,20-Dec-2010,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/1804259.pdf,Zero carbon for new non-domestic buildings consultation: summary of responses,"This report provides a summary of responses to the consultation document, _Zero carbon for new non-domestic buildings._ The consultation related to proposals for working towards the ambition that all new non-domestic buildings should be zero carbon from 2019, with the public sector leading the way from 2018.

An overview of responses to all questions shows that:

  * there was strong support for the majority of the proposals on zero carbon non-domestic buildings, with 75% or more respondents agreeing with six of the nine questions to which they could answer 'Yes'
  * around half of respondents were in favour of balancing on-site and off-site measures, with similar proportions supporting off-site rich and on-site rich measures - a significant proportion of developers/builders favoured the off-site rich scenario
  * there was little support for the proposal to set a flat rate requirement above 100% regulated emissions to account for unregulated emissions and there was a mixed reaction to the package of measures and proposals for next steps
  * overall, there were no marked sectoral differences in views and any differences were question-dependent - however, support for some of the proposals was less strong among the energy sector
  * the overall numbers responding to each of the 13 questions ranged between 83 and 98, with all questions attracting a response rate of 75% or more",9781409825999,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/newnondomesticconsult?view=Order+form&supplierId=1403822,Order this publication,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/1391110.pdf,Zero carbon for New Non-Domestic Buildings: Consultation on policy options,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/doc/1416885.doc,Zero Carbon for New Non-domestic Buildings: Consultation on Policy Options,http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/doc/1391113.doc,Response form: Zero carbon for New Non-Domestic Buildings Consultation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On 21 July 2009 Communities and Local Government published a consultation document titled _Reform of Council Housing_. This included an option of dismantling the current Housing Revenue Account subsidy system and replacing it with a devolved system of financing and accountability termed self-financing. Under self-financing council landlords would keep all their rental income and use it to finance their own stock, ending the annual subsidy relationship with Government.

_Council Housing: A real future_ sets out detailed proposals for reforming council housing finance and seeks the views of councils on implementing this new system.
