  # Rails automatically defines methods called
  # `validate_associated_records_for_<association>` for any association that is
  # autosaved or validated. These methods run validations on each associated
  # EditionOrganisation and Organisation, which causes an otherwise-valid edition
  # to become invalid if any linked organisation is invalid (for example, because
  # of an overlong custom_jobs_url). We donâ€™t want an invalid organisation to
  # block publication of an edition, so we override these methods to no-op.
  #
  # Presence and uniqueness of associated organisations are already enforced
  # by our own custom validators, so skipping these auto-generated validations
  # has no negative side-effects.
