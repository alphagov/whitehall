  # This 'grace period' reflects the fact that an Edition will end up with a
  # slightly earlier `created_at` timestamp compared to Attachments belonging to
  # that Edition. This is because Attachments are created after the Edition
  # itself has been created (see the `process_associations_after_save` method).
  #
  # This needs to be taken into account when trying to identify whether an
  # Attachment is 'new' on this Edition, or if it was copied across from the
  # previous Edition of a Document (see the `changed_attachments` method).
