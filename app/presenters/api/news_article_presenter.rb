Previously, the St Edward’s Crown was used by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E The design of the Tudor Crown can be distinguished by its slightly more domed appearance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs His Majesty’s Government, GOV.UK and other instances of the crown across the Government estate are being changed to reflect the new reign.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe crown logo is an important part of the GOV.UK brand, and GOV.UK one of the most recognisable and trusted digital services  in the UK.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, the GOV.UK logo began its transition to recognise the chosen crown of His Majesty the King on its homepage and sitewide menu bar. The transition is covered within the usual operating costs of the GOV.UK website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n  \u003Cp\u003EFollowing the accession of His Majesty The King, we are updating the symbols of state to reflect the new design of the Tudor Crown.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp class=\"last-child\"\u003EThe digital realm is now an integral part of our lives, and as His Majesty’s Government we take pride in this change to GOV.UK today, honouring the chosen crown of our King.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith GOV.UK used by millions of people every single week, it is important people are aware of this change\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E The image below shows the old (top) and the new logo (bottom). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"image embedded\"\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"img\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65d34302e1bdec7737322248/Untitled__2_.png\" alt=\"\"\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhilst the new domed shape can be identified, the bold, simple aesthetic of GOV.UK remains the same. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf in doubt during this time of transition, the public are encouraged to report misleading and fraudulent GOV.UK-styled websites via the dedicated \u003Ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/report-suspicious-emails-websites-phishing\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003Ereporting page\u003C/a\u003E on GOV.UK. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EParliamentary Secretary for the Cabinet Office, Alex Burghart, said: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n  \u003Cp\u003EGOV.UK is an essential part of living, studying and working in the UK. It is used by millions of people weekly for both routine and sometimes life-changing reasons such as getting access to benefits or finding a job. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp class=\"last-child\"\u003EWhilst we are importantly updating the GOV.UK logo to reflect the new monarch’s choice of crown, this site remains the same trusted and official digital home of the UK government.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new logo has been created collaboratively between the Government Digital Service (GDS), the Government Communication Service (GCS) and the Royal Household.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe majority of changes to replace the St Edward’s Crown with the Tudor Crown logo on GOV.UK are expected to have taken place by 1 March. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChristine Bellamy, Director of GOV.UK at the Government Digital Service (GDS), said: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n  \u003Cp\u003EOver the decade GOV.UK has been live, we’ve earned the trust of the population to become a crucial part of civic life. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EWe take this responsibility seriously, and it’s fantastic to see the GOV.UK logo updated to reflect the new symbols of state. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp\u003EWe have worked with teams across government to ensure the roll-out is smooth, and feels seamless to our users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n  \u003Cp class=\"last-child\"\u003EThe change will also be made on other government channels, that use the GOV.UK logo, such as apps. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGOV.UK is the website for the UK government and the best place to find government services and information. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Government Digital Service closely monitors online channels to ensure that any websites using protected government branding, or incorrectly claiming to be affiliated with the government, are reported and, if not resolved, taken down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E",
