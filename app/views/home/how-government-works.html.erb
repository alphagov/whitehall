            <h3>Government departments</h3>
            <p>Some departments, like the Ministry of Defence, cover the UK as a whole. Other departments don’t – for example, the Department for Work and Pensions covers England, Wales and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland. This is because some aspects of government are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
            
            <h3 class="with-gutter">Non-ministerial government departments</h3>
            <p>These are headed by senior civil servants and not ministers. They usually have a regulatory or inspection function like the Charity Commission.</p>
            
            <h3 class="with-gutter">Executive agencies</h3>
            <p>These are part of government departments and usually provide government services rather than decide policy - which is done by the department that oversees the agency.</p> 
            
            <p>An example is the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (overseen by the Department for Transport).</p>

            <p>These have varying degrees of independence but are directly accountable to ministers. There are 4 types of Non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).</p>
            
            <h3 class="with-gutter">Executive NDPBs</h3>
            <p>These do work for the government in specific areas - for example the Environment Agency.</p>
            
            <h3 class="with-gutter">Advisory NDPBs</h3>
            <p>These provide independent, expert advice to ministers - for example the Committee on Standards in Public Life.</p>
            
            <h3 class="with-gutter">Tribunal NDPBs</h3>
            <p>These are part of the justice system and have jurisdiction over a specific area of law - for example the Competition Appeal Tribunal.</p>
            
            <h3 class="with-gutter">Independent monitoring boards</h3>
            <p>These are responsible for the running of prisons and treatment of prisoners - for example Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons.</p>
