            <h3>Government departments</h3>
            <p>Some departments, like the Ministry of Defence, cover the  whole UK. Others don’t – the Department for Work and Pensions doesn't cover Northern Ireland. This is because some aspects of government are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p>Non-ministerial departments are headed by senior civil servants and not ministers. They usually have a regulatory or inspection function like the Charity Commission.</p>
            
            <h3 class="with-gutter">Executive agencies</h3>
            <p>These are part of government departments and usually provide government services rather than decide policy - which is done by the department that oversees the agency.</p>
            
            <p>An example is the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (overseen by the Department for Transport).</p>

            <h3>Other public bodies</h3>
            <p>These have varying degrees of independence but are directly accountable to ministers. There are 4 types of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).</p>
            
            <p>Executive NDPBs do work for the government in specific areas - for example, the Environment Agency.</p>
            
            <p>Advisory NDPBs provide independent, expert advice to ministers - for example, the Committee on Standards in Public Life.</p>
            
            <p>Tribunal NDPBs are part of the justice system and have jurisdiction over a specific area of law - for example, the Competition Appeal Tribunal.</p>
            
            <p>Independent monitoring boards are responsible for the running of prisons and treatment of prisoners - for example, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons.</p>
