            <p class="govuk-body"><%= link_to "Non-ministerial departments", "/government/organisations#non_ministerial_departments", class: "govuk-link" %> are headed by senior civil servants and not ministers. They usually have a regulatory or inspection function like the Charity Commission.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">These have varying degrees of independence but are directly accountable to ministers. There are 4 types of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Executive NDPBs do work for the government in specific areas - for example, the Environment Agency.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Advisory NDPBs provide independent, expert advice to ministers - for example, the Committee on Standards in Public Life.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Tribunal NDPBs are part of the justice system and have jurisdiction over a specific area of law - for example, the Competition Appeal Tribunal.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Independent monitoring boards are responsible for the running of prisons and treatment of prisoners - for example, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons.</p>
