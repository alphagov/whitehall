            <p>Some departments, like the <a href="/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence">Ministry of Defence</a>, cover the  whole UK. Others don’t – the <a href="/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions">Department for Work and Pensions</a> doesn't cover Northern Ireland. This is because some aspects of government are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p><a href="/government/organisations#non-ministerial-departments">Non-ministerial departments</a> are headed by senior civil servants and not ministers. They usually have a regulatory or inspection function like the Charity Commission.</p>

            <h3 class="with-gutter">Executive agencies</h3>
            <p>These are part of government departments and usually provide government services rather than decide policy - which is done by the department that oversees the agency.</p>

            <p>An example is the <a href="/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency">Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency</a> (overseen by the <a href="/government/organisations/department-for-transport">Department for Transport</a>).</p>

            <p>These have varying degrees of independence but are directly accountable to ministers. There are 4 types of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).</p>

            <p>Executive NDPBs do work for the government in specific areas - for example, the Environment Agency.</p>

            <p>Advisory NDPBs provide independent, expert advice to ministers - for example, the Committee on Standards in Public Life.</p>

            <p>Tribunal NDPBs are part of the justice system and have jurisdiction over a specific area of law - for example, the Competition Appeal Tribunal.</p>

            <p>Independent monitoring boards are responsible for the running of prisons and treatment of prisoners - for example, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons.</p>
