          <h2>Why is history important?</h2>
          <p class="intro">Governments are remembered for their leaders and the course they set for their country. Were the people free; did they have bread? Were they trained to fight, or trade and teach instead?</p>
          <p>Exploring how and why a decision was taken &ndash; also where and by whom &ndash; helps us produce a picture of the past. The values, pressures and ambitions which influenced the choices made by government. The people who benefited, those who lost out. By looking back, we can discover parallels with the present, and shape our expectations of the future.</p>
          <p>The information on these pages is not intended to be a complete history, but to provide a useful starting point for research. It includes objective factual content and research carried out by independent and civil service historians.</p>
