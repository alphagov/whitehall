          Sometimes it may be necessary to republish content to the Publishing API. This will refresh the content on the website.

        <p class="govuk-body">
          For example, if we make an update to govspeak and a publishing application pre-renders that content prior to its submission to Publishing API, that would require us to re-render and save new HTML for content.

        <p class="govuk-body">
          The following actions will allow you to republish content that was originally published in this application.
          Any linked editions will also be republished through dependency resolution.
          Try to pick the republishing task most focused to the scope of what you need to republish to avoid unnecessary server load.

    <h2>Bulk republishing</h2>
    
    <%# should we link to Grafana/the Sidekiq web interface/the docs here, so folks have a way of checking the status of queued jobs if they want? https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/sidekiq.html#monitoring %>

      You can schedule multiple pieces of content for republishing using the links below. Note that this might take some time to take effect since bulk republishing jobs are added to a low priority queue.
