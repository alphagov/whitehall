name: Datetime fields
description: Use the datetime fields component to help users enter a datetime for a specific event.
body: |
  This differs from the [Date fields][] component in a few notable ways:
    1. In addition, to day, month and year, it also takes hour and minute
    2. It generates select fields in place of inputs
    3. As this uses the `ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper` helpers you must
    provide a prefix and field_name to construct the fields
     - the prefix must be the downcased and underscored model name
     - the field_name is the attribute for the model

accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must:

  - accept focus
  - be focusable with a keyboard
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - be usable with touch
  - indicate when they have focus
  - be recognisable as form select elements
  - have correctly associated labels
examples:
  default:
    data:
      name: first_published_at
      legend_text: First published at
      date:
        legend_text: Date
      time:
        legend_text: Time
