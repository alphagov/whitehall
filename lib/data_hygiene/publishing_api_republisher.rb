module DataHygiene
  # Can be used to republish a bunch of models to the Publishing API.
  #
  # Usage:
  #
  #   scope = CaseStudy.published
  #   publisher = DataHygiene::PublishingApiRepublisher.new(scope)
  #   publisher.perform
  #
  # Note: Whitehall::PublishingApi will raise an exception if an attempt is made
  # to publish an instance that is not currently supported (e.g. draft editions
  # cannot be pubilshed yet). The scope passed in should not include any
  # instances that are not publishable.
