module CarrierWave
  class SanitizedFile
    # CarrierWave has been designed with the assumption that your files will
    # be uploaded to and served from the same directory. We've added a virus
    # checking step, and so have two folders involved ("incoming" and "clean").
    #
    # By default, CarrierWave will generate the URL of an asset by taking its
    # path relative to the folder it was uploaded to (e.g. /public) and append
    # it to `asset_host`.
    #
    # We've changed this behaviour by defining this `url` method, which returns
    # a consistent value regardless of whether or not an uploaded file has been
    # checked for viruses, as the view code (that calls it) needs to return the
    # same URL in both cases.

      CarrierWaveFilePath.new(path).to_public_path
