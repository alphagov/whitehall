# Content Block Manager

Content Block Manager is used by publishers to create and manage "blocks" on content
that can be reused and kept up to date across various pieces of content.

All the documentation can be found [in the Whitehall docs directory](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/blob/main/docs/content_block_manager.md)
