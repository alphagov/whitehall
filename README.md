# Whitehalls

Whitehall (also known as 'Whitehall Admin' or 'Whitehall Publisher') is used by publishers to create and manage content (e.g. <http://whitehall-admin.dev.gov.uk/government/admin/news/new>).

## Running the Application

**Use [GOV.UK Docker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker) to run any commands that follow.**

## Nomenclature

- *Govspeak* A variation of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) used throughout whitehall as the general publishing format

## Technical documentation

This is a Ruby on Rails app, and should follow [our Rails app conventions](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/conventions-for-rails-applications.html).

You can use the [GOV.UK Docker environment](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker) to run the application and its tests with all the necessary dependencies. Follow [the usage instructions](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker#usage) to get started.

### Running the test suite

These commands assume you have the [GOV.UK Docker environment](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker) running and its binaries in your PATH.

```
# run all the test suites
govuk-docker-run bundle exec rake
```

Javascript unit tests can also be run separately:

```
# run all the JavaScript tests
govuk-docker-run bundle exec rake jasmine
```
