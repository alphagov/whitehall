This policy definition is a sample only, to give a flavour of what GOV.UK might look like if it contained a full list of government policies from all central departments. The title has been adapted from the text of the #{lead_org.name} business plan, published May 2011, and may therefore be out of date.

For accurate, reliable and up to date information on this policy, visit the #{lead_org.name} website at [#{url}](#{url})}
